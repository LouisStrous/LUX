The main author of this program is Louis Strous, currently a software
engineer in Leiden, the Netherlands.  This program is a fork of the
ANA program originally written by Richard A. Shine of the Lockheed
Martin Solar & Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL) in Palo Alto,
California.  Strous started using ANA in 1989, as a PhD student from
Utrecht University in the Netherlands collaborating with LMSAL.
Strous has improved it since 1990, also while working for the New
Jersey Institute of Technology and the National Solar Observatory
(1995 - 1998), and LMSAL (1998 - 2000).  The Strous and Shine versions
of ANA drifted apart, especially after Strous moved back to the
Netherlands at the end of 2000.
