Change Log of LUX

- <2013-09-23 Mon> lux@quae.nl v1.0.1
  - Fix reading commands from file; got broken during recent
    replacement of home-grown command line editor for GNU readline.
  - Make bindings to SOFA routines work again; stopped working after
    switching to linking most object files (except lux.o containing
    the main entry point) into liblux.a before linking lux.o and
    liblux.a into the final lux executable.  Fixed by linking all
    object files directly into the LUX binary.  Also keeping liblux.a,
    because that makes building the unit test binaries easier.
