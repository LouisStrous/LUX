    does not.
  - Fix a^b for BYTE/LONG/FLOAT/DOUBLE array a and DOUBLE scalar b.

    INT64, INT64ARR, INT64FARR, INT64MAP.
  - Withdraw subroutine ARRAY_STATISTICS.
  - Add #EPS_FLOAT, #EPS_DOUBLE
- <2014-07-05 Sat> lux@quae.nl v1.0.3

- <2013-10-10 Thu> lux@quae.nl v1.0.2
  - Replace "ANA" bitmap by new "LUX" bitmap.
  - Make !CPUTIME return higher resolution results, if supported by
    the system.
  - Introduce new KEPLER function to solve Kepler's equation.
  - Fix MEDFILTER, ORDFILTER functions, which were broken on 64-bit
    systems.
- <2013-09-23 Mon> lux@quae.nl v1.0.1
  - Fix reading commands from file; got broken during recent
    replacement of home-grown command line editor for GNU readline.
  - Make bindings to SOFA routines work again; stopped working after
    switching to linking most object files (except lux.o containing
    the main entry point) into liblux.a before linking lux.o and
    liblux.a into the final lux executable.  Fixed by linking all
    object files directly into the LUX binary.  Also keeping liblux.a,
    because that makes building the unit test binaries easier.
