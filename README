  The current project makes use of the "Standards of Fundamental
  Astronomy (SOFA)" Library for ANSI C, obtained from
  [http://www.iausofa.org/index.html].

  That library comes complete with its own "makefile", which is not
  suitable for including in an autoconfiscated project such as the
  current one.  The SOFA sources were adapted as follows for inclusion
  into the current project:

  1. Change into the "sofa" subdirectory of the current project's main
     directory:

     cd sofa

  2. Extract the sofa sources from the tarball:

     tar xzf Location_of_Tarball/sofa_c-20120301_a.tar.gz

     This yields a subdirectory "sofa" in the current directory, which
     is itself also called "sofa" (i.e., the new subdirectory is
     "sofa/sofa" relative to the project's main directory).

  3. Locate the "c" subdirectory in the extracted sources (it is
     several directory levels down) and copy its contents into the
     current directory:

     cp -r sofa/20120301_a/c/* .

  4. Remove the extracted directory, as it is not needed anymore:

     rm -rf sofa

  5. Rename SOFA's original "makefile" so it is not run and causes no
     trouble:

     mv src/makefile src/original-makefile

  6. Create our own "src/Makefile.am" that builds "libsofa_c.a" from
     the SOFA *.c and *.h files in the "src" subdirectory.
