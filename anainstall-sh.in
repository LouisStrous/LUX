WARNING - I could not determine the type of operating system/computer
(i.e., the platform) that you are using, so the installation script
will not work exactly as planned!  The installation script (run by
"make install") is supposed to install the executable in a
platform-dependent subdirectory, but now it will use a
platform-independent location instead.
