@chapter Typographical Conventions

@cindex Typographical conventions
@cindex Font use in the manual
@cindex Conventions for font use

This document uses the following typographical conventions:

@table @asis
@item A single key.
A single key, for instance the key marked "A", is written as
@kbd{a} if it is pressed without the shift key, @kbd{A} if it is pressed
with the shift key.  The following special key names are used in the LUX
Manual: 

@table @kbd
@item Return
The key marked "Return" or "Enter", which signals completion of the
input.
@item SPC
The "space" bar, which generates a single whitespace.
@item TAB
The key marked "Tab", which advances the cursor to the next tab
position.
@item Backspace
The key marked "Backspace", which rubs out the character before the
cursor, and moves all text below and after the cursor back by one
position.
@item Delete
The key marked "Del" or "Delete", which rubs out the character under the
cursor, and moves all text after the cursor back by one position.
@item ESC
The key marked "Esc" or "Escape", which is used as introduction to
multi-key editor sequences.
@item Downarrow
The down-arrow key.
@item Uparrow
The up-arrow key.
@item Rightarrow
The right-arrow key.
@item Leftarrow
The left-arrow key.
@item Insert
The key marked "Insert", which toggles between insert and overwrite
mode.
@end table

Most keys change their meaning when they are typed while the key marked
"Control" or "Ctrl" is being kept pressed down.  Such an occurrence is
described in this manual by prepending @kbd{C-} to the name of the key
being pressed while the "Control" key is also pressed.  For instance,
pressing the "Control" key, pressing the @kbd{x} key, releasing the
@kbd{x} key, and releasing the "Control" key generates a key sequence
written as @kbd{C-x} in this manual.  Such a @emph{control sequence}
counts as a single keystroke.

@item A sequence of keystrokes.
A sequence of keystrokes that you type at the keyboard, for instance a
@kbd{t} followed by a comma (@kbd{,}), two whitespaces (@kbd{SPC}), and
a @kbd{6}, is indicated like this: @kbd{t,  6}.

@item A meta-variable name.
The name of a meta-variable in LUX, for instance the one that stands for
a general expression, is indicated as follows: @code{@var{expr}}.

@item Some LUX code.
Some arbitrary (legal) LUX code is written as follows: @code{T,6}.  Only
uppercase letters are used in names of functions and routines and in
reserved LUX key words.  The example code used for illustration here
would follow from the example used for the sequence of keystrokes,
above.

@chapter Starting and Stopping LUX.

@cindex Starting LUX
@cindex Exiting LUX
@cindex Quitting LUX
@cindex Stopping LUX
@cindex Initialization file
@cindex Start-up file

(To install LUX on your computer system, see @ref{Installing LUX}).  You
begin a LUX session by typing at the keyboard the name of the program
on your system (probably @kbd{lux}).  After some initialization and a
greeting message, the main LUX prompt appears:
@example
LUX>
@end example
LUX is now ready to take your commands.  Any complete command that you
type is executed immediately.  For example, if you type the command
@kbd{t,'Hello, world!'} and press the @kbd{RET} key, then the screen
looks something like this:
@example
LUX>t,'Hello, world!'
Hello, world!
LUX>
@end example
The @code{T} command is a synonym of @code{TYPE} (@ref{TYPE}) and
@code{PRINT} (@ref{PRINT}), and displays its arguments on the screen.
LUX has executed your command and is waiting for the next one.

You end a LUX session by entering the @code{QUIT} command (@ref{QUIT}),
or the equivalent @code{EXIT} command (@ref{EXIT});

If you want some initialization commands to be executed automatically
when LUX starts up, then put those commands in file @file{.luxinit} in
your home directory.  The contents of that file are read and executed
automatically when LUX starts.

@section Shell Command Line Arguments

@cindex Command line arguments of the invoking command
@cindex Options, specified when starting LUX
@cindex Shell command line arguments for LUX
@cindex Arguments to the command invoking LUX

When you start up LUX then any text on the command line after the
command name that starts LUX (probably @file{lux}) is passed to LUX as
if you typed it at the @code{LUX>} prompt.  Just remember that such text
may be changed by the shell before it is passed on to LUX, just like any
other shell arguments.

For instance, if you invoke LUX as follows:
@example
 lux @@file
@end example
then -- assuming the shell does not modify the argument -- LUX starts up
and starts reading input from the @file{file}, just like if you typed
@code{lux}, waited for the @code{LUX>} prompt, and then typed
@code{@@file}.

The quote (') character is removed by most shells, so invocations such
as
@example
 lux type,'alpha'
@end example
will pass the statement @code{type,alpha} to LUX, which generates an
error because no variable named @code{alpha} is defined when LUX first
starts.  In this case, to pass quotes to LUX, you can enclose the whole
argument list between double quotes ("), or prepend backslashes (\) to
the quotes; i.e.,
@example
 lux type,\'alpha\'
@end example
and
@example
 lux "type,'alpha'"
@end example
should work.  The latter form is better, because it also protects some
other characters that are special to the shell from being modified.

@section Batch Mode

@cindex Batch mode
@cindex Running LUX unconnected to a terminal
@cindex Running LUX in the background

You can have LUX run in @emph{batch mode}: in the background,
unconnected to a terminal, even after you have logged out.  To make this
work, you need to be able to do three things:

@enumerate
@item
Make LUX take all input from a disk file rather than from the keyboard.
@item
Make LUX send all output to a disk file or discard it rather than
send it to the screen.
@item
Put LUX in the background where it can run unconnected to any terminal.
@end enumerate

The first item can be taken care of by LUX itself; the last two items
must be done by the shell in which you start LUX.  Of course, you cannot
use any commands that generate screen output or that rely on screen or
mouse input if the LUX process is unconnected to a terminal.

To make LUX read commands from a file, use file inclusion (@ref{File
Inclusion}): The command
 @example
  @@file
 @end example
makes LUX read commands from file @file{file.lux}.  However, if the file
contains a command that requests user input, then such input is read
from the keyboard by default.  You can instruct LUX to read such input
from the file, too, by issuing the @code{BATCH} command (@ref{BATCH}).

The following discussion of input and output redirection and of
background processes is valid for most Unix-type operating systems.

In most Unix-type shells, you make a command send all output to a disk
file by appending a file name after a greater-than (>) sign to the
command line, and make the command take input from a disk file by
appending a file name after a less-than (<) sign, and make the command
run in the background, unconnected to any terminal, by ending the
command line with an ampersand (&) sign.

The command
@example
lux batch statements exit > outputfile &
@end example
executes the listed statements in LUX, takes all input (if any) from the
read files, sends all output to file @file{outputfile}, and runs in the
background.  In this case, you must explicitly tell LUX to exit (using
the @code{EXIT} command, @ref{EXIT}) when it is done, or else it will
hang around in the background waiting for more input.  If no additional
user input is required during execution of the statements, then you can
leave out the @code{BATCH} command.  In most cases, the shell will
complain if file @file{outputfile} already exists.  If you use double
greater-than signs (>>) rather than a single one, then the output is
appended to @file{outputfile}, which may or may not already exist.  In
some shells, if you use a greater-than sign followed by an exclamation
mark (>!), then if @code{outputfile} already exists its previous
contents are discarded.

If all of your LUX commands are in a single file @file{inputfile}, then
you can also use the following command to execute these commands in the
background:
@example
lux < inputfile > outputfile &
@end example
If LUX finds that it cannot get more input because it has read all of
the input file and it is not connected to a terminal (as in this case),
then it quits, so you do not need to have an @code{EXIT} command at the
end of @file{inputfile} in this case.

If you are running LUX connected to a terminal and then decide you'd
rather have it continue in the background, then you can send it the
"suspend" interrupt signal, commonly generated by pressing @kbd{C-Z},
and then type the shell command @code{bg} to put the session in the
background.  However, you cannot have subsequent output be sent to a
file in this way, so if LUX generates any output after it is put in the
background in this way, then the process will hang around until it gets
reattached to a terminal.  Likewise, if LUX is ready for more input, the
process will wait around for that.  To reattach the process to the
terminal, type @code{fg}.

@chapter Tutorial

This chapter gives an overview of the basic details of LUX.  It skips
many of the fine details, but gives pointers to where you can find more
about such details.  After reading this tutorial, you may be interested
to see a listing of most of LUX's routines by category: @ref{Routine
Groups}.  WARNING: This chapter is new and yet incomplete.

Once you've installed (@ref{Installing LUX}) and started up the LUX
program (@ref{Start & Stop}), you can type commands at the @code{LUX>}
prompt (@ref{Command Input}).  Our first example program prints the
string @code{hello, world!} on the screen.  In LUX, this is simply
@example
LUX>t,'hello, world!'
hello, world!
LUX>
@end example
The @code{LUX>} at the beginning of the line is the prompt, which
indicates that LUX is ready to accept your commands.  The @code{T}
subroutine (synonyms: @code{TYPE}, @code{PRINT}; @ref{T},
@ref{Subroutine Call}) prints its comma-separated arguments to the
screen, using default output formats (@ref{Formatted Input/Output}).
The argument in this case is a literal string (@ref{Strings}).  LUX also
knows about numbers.  You can specify integer numbers in various bases,
and also floating-point numbers with optional exponents (@ref{Scalars}).

LUX does not distinguish between lower case and upper case letters,
except inside literal strings.  Also, addition of arbitrary amounts of
whitespace (blanks) is ignored except inside literal strings and inside
names.  So, the first example could also have been given as
@example
LUX>  TyPe  ,    'hello, world!'
hello, world!
LUX>
@end example

Besides subroutines such as @code{T}, LUX also offers many functions,
which take arguments and return a value (@ref{Function Call}).  For
example,
@example
LUX>t,sin(1)
      0.841471
LUX>
@end example
shows the value returned by the trigonometric sine function (@ref{SIN},
@ref{Trigonometry}) for the argument @code{1} (measured in radians in
this case).  Arguments to functions must be separated by commas, and the
whole argument list must be enclosed in parentheses.  You can change the
format in which the result is printed (@ref{Formatted Input/Output}).
Besides functions, LUX knows a number of other operations that yield
values (@ref{Operators}), including arithmetic operators such as
addition and multiplication, and also operators that compare their
operands (@ref{Binary Relationals}), perform binary logic on them
(@ref{Binary Logic}), and a number of others.

One of the strengths of LUX is that it is easy to work with large sets
of numbers, in arrays (@ref{Arrays}).  You can specify an array by
listing its members explicitly, e.g.,
@example
LUX>x=[1,2,6,12]
LUX>t,x
         1         2         6        12
LUX>
@end example
assigns a four-element array to the variable named @code{x}
(@ref{Variables}, @ref{Square Brackets}).  In assignments like this, the
variable assumes the data class (@ref{Data Classes}) and type, if any,
of the expression that is assigned to it (@ref{Expressions}): you do not
need to declare the type of the variable beforehand.  You can also use
one of the many functions in LUX that generate arrays (@ref{Array
Creation}).  The data values in arrays are arranged in a specific
coordinate system that may have several dimensions (up to
@code{#MAX_DIMS} of them, actually -- @ref{#MAX_DIMS}).  For example,
you can create an array of 3 by 4 elements which contain as values their
index counted from the start of the array:
@example
LUX>x=indgen(lonarr(3,4))
LUX>t,x
         0         1         2         3         4         5         6
         7         8         9        10        11
LUX>d,x
195 X         array, LONG, #elem = 12, (3,4)
LUX>
@end example
In this example, the @code{LONARR} function (@ref{LONARR}) creates and
returns a @code{LONG} (four-byte integer, @ref{Numerical Data Types})
array of 3 by 4 elements with unspecified values for its elements.  The
@code{INDGEN} function (@ref{INDGEN}) that is applied to this array
fills each element of its argument array with its index, counted from
the start of the array.  The @code{D} subroutine (@ref{D}, a synonym of
@code{DUMP}) displays basic information about the variable or variables
that are specified as its arguments.  In this case, it shows that
@code{x} is a @code{LONG} array of 3 by 4 elements, making 12 elements
in total.  Note that in assignments, the variable that is assigned to
loses any previous contents it might have had -- in this case, the
earlier contents @code{[1,2,6,12]} are deleted and replaced by the new
contents.  The new contents need not be of the same class or type as the
old contents.

You can inspect particular elements of an array in various ways
(@ref{Subscripts}).  The most basic way is to specify the coordinates of
the element you wish, separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses,
but you can also inspect ranges of elements:
@example
LUX>t,x(2,3)
        11
LUX>t,x(0:1,2:*)
         6         7         9        10
@end example
The asterisk @code{*} in the second command means "through the end of
the array in the current coordinate", and the semicolons @code{:}
separate the specification of the beginning of each range from the
specification of the end.

You modify particular elements of an array using similar subscripts on
the left-hand side of the equal sign (@kbd{=}):
@example
LUX>x(2,3) = 17
LUX>x(0:1,2:*) = [1, 2, 3, 4]
@end example
Lines like the previous ones, that instruct LUX to perform a particular
task, and after which LUX is ready to accept another command, are called
@emph{statements}.  You've already seen assignment statements
(@ref{Assignment}) and subroutine calls such as the ones to subroutine
@code{T} (@ref{Subroutine Call}), but there are many more
(@ref{Statements}).  You can repeat particular statements using
@code{FOR}, @code{REPEAT-UNTIL}, @code{WHILE-DO}, or @code{DO-WHILE}
statements.  You can select particular statements for execution from a
number of statements, using an @code{IF}, @code{CASE}, or @code{NCASE}
statement.

Whatever you type at the keyboard is only passed on to LUX's interpreter
when you press the @kbd{RET} key.  Before you do that, you can edit the
command line in various ways, described below.  Most of the editing
commands are the same as those in the Emacs editor.

During command line input, the leftmost four columns of the screen are
reserved for the display of @emph{prompts}, which convey information
about the status of the input.  The rightmost column of the screen is
reserved for the continuation character @kbd{-}, which is displayed
whenever the input is too long to fit on a single screen line.  The
columns between the prompt and continuation columns are used to display
your input.

On input, any non-printable characters that are not recognized as
editing commands (for instance tabs) are treated as whitespace.

@cindex Data I/O routines
@cindex Input/Output routines

LUX provides data input/output to screen, disk file, or tape.  The data
can be either formatted or unformatted -- adjectives which refer to
formatting for human consumption.  Formatted data can be easily read by
humans, and unformatted data is better suited for the computer.
Unformatted data usually takes less space than formatted data.

The order in which data bytes are stored in memory or in a file depends
on what computer you are using.  LUX's native file format (FZ) knows how
to deal with this, and LUX also offers some routines to switch between
the two most-used data byte orders.

@subsection Disk File Input/Output

@cindex Disk file I/O
@cindex Input from disk files
@cindex Output to disk files

Both output to and input from disk files is provided through associated
variables (created through subroutine @code{ASSOC}) and file arrays
(created through subroutine @code{FLTFARR} and cousins), which behave to
some extent like ordinary data arrays.

Output to disk files is also provided through classical file operations,
such as opening disk files for writing (subroutines @code{OPENW} and
@code{OPENU}), writing to disk files (subroutines @code{PRINTF} and
@code{FPRINTF} for formatted output, @code{WRITEU} for unformatted
output).

Input from disk files is likewise provided through opening disk files
for reading (subroutine @code{OPENR}), reading from disk files
(subroutines @code{READF} and @code{FREADF} for formatted input,
@code{READU} for unformatted input).

Also useful in these cases is repositioning the file pointer (subroutine
@code{FILEPTR}), closing disk files (subroutine @code{CLOSE}), and
getting the disk file size (function @code{FILESIZE}).

In addition, LUX supports input and output of files according to various
standard formats, such as uncompressed GIF files (@code{GIFREAD},
@code{GIFWRITE}), lossy compressed JPEG files (@code{JPEGREAD},
@code{JPEGWRITE}), FITS files with or without extensions
(@code{FITS_READ}, @code{FITS_WRITE}), and LUX's own FZ format, which
comes in uncompressed (@code{FZREAD}, @code{FZWRITE}) and compressed
flavors (@code{FCWRITE}).  Unformatted files can be transformed into FZ
files, using @code{FILETOFZ}.

The LUX FZ file format allows storage of data in uncompressed or

is of the Rice type, with or without run-length encoding.  The data type
and dimensions are encoded in the file.

@subsubsection LUX FITS File Format

FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System and is a file format
developed by the astronomical community for data exchange and storage.
For general information, see the FITS Support Office home page at
@code{http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_home.html}.  

An LUX FITS file containing uncompressed data has the standard
@code{SIMPLE, BITPIX, NAXIS}, and @code{NAXISn} records, and any general
user-specified header text is placed on one or more @code{COMMENT} lines
beyond the last @code{NAXISn} record.

For LUX FITS file that contain compressed data we define a few
LUX-specific FITS keywords.  A typical example of the header of such a
file is displayed below.

@example
SIMPLE  =                    T / LUX Rice compressed
BITPIX  =                    8
NAXIS   =                    1
NAXIS1  =               217750
COMPRESS= 'RICE    ' / used type of compression
UBITPIX =                   16 / BITPIX of uncompressed data
UNAXIS  =                    2 / NAXIS of uncompressed data
UNAXIS1 =                  464 / dimension of uncompressed data
UNAXIS2 =                  438 / dimension of uncompressed data
COMMENT = user-defined header text
END
@end example

The @code{BITPIX, NAXIS,} and @code{NAXISn} keywords refer to the actual
data in the rest of the FITS file, as the standard demands.  In this
case, 217750 bytes of compressed data follow.  The type of compression
is described by the @code{COMPRESS} line, which may currently hold
either of the values @code{'RICE    '} for Rice compression without
run-length encoding, and @code{'RICE RLE '} for Rice compression with
run-length encoding.  The type and dimensions of the uncompressed data
are indicated by the lines with the @code{U} keywords, and any general
user-defined header text is stored on one or more @code{COMMENT} lines.

@subsection Byte Order

@cindex Disk file byte order
@cindex Bigendian machine
@cindex Littleendian machine
@cindex Byte order in multi-byte data formats

All information in computers is stored in the form of bits, where each
bit can be either a 0 or a 1.  Most modern computers use as the unit of
memory a byte, which consists of eight bits and which can contain 256
different values.  LUX's data types (@ref{Numerical Data Types}) all
consist of an integral number of bytes.  If a data value consists of
more than one byte, then the byte that counts the smallest units of the
value is called the @emph{least significant byte} and the byte that
counts the biggest units of the value is called the @emph{most
significant byte}.  The bytes of a multi-byte data value can be stored
in memory in different orders.  The two byte orders used the most are
the one in ascending order of significance, often referred to as
@emph{little-endian} (because you start at the end of the "little"
values), and the one in descending order of significance, often called
@emph{bigendian}.

What happens if you try to read data on a bigendian machine that was
written on a littleendian one?  If you use any of the classical file I/O
operations (i.e., following @code{OPENR} or @code{OPENU}), or use direct
mapping of an array structure onto a disk file (i.e., @code{ASSOC} or
@code{FLTFARR} and its cousins), then LUX cannot automatically correct
for the byte order discrepancy, because arbitrary files do not contain
indications of how many bytes make up a value, and what their byte order
might be.  However, LUX provides the routine @code{ENDIAN}, which
switches the byte order of the data in a variable from littleendian to
bigendian or the other way around, so in this case you can read the data
as usual and then switch its byte order if necessary.

If you use files that conform to LUX's own FZ format (written using,
e.g., @code{FZWRITE}, @code{FCWRITE}, or @code{STORE}) then the data's
type and byte order are included in the file's header so any necessary
corrections for byte order discrepancies are taken care of
automatically.  If you create such a file, then the data is always
written in your machine's native byte order.

The @code{FZARR} function which assigns an array structure to an FZ disk
file does not correct for byte order discrepancies, even though the FZ
file contains byte order information.  This is because @code{FZARR}
returns an appropriate file array (@ref{File Arrays}) to access the file
data and file arrays do not contain byte order information.  This means
that if you copy a file from a bigendian machine to a littleendian
machine, or the other way around, then you cannot use a file array to
access that data (except if you combine such access with the use of
@code{ENDIAN}).

To find out if your computer is bigendian or littleendian, you can check
the value of read-only global variable @code{#MSBFIRST}: if it is equal
to @code{1}, then the most significant byte comes first (i.e., your
computer is bigendian), and if it is equal to @code{0}, then the least
significant byte comes first (it is littleendian).

Another way is to execute @code{T,BMAP(1)}.  If the result is @code{0 0
0 1}, then your computer is bigendian; if the result is @code{1 0 0 0}
then your computer is littleendian.

@section Formatted Input/Output

@cindex Formatted I/O
@cindex Input formatting
@cindex Output formatting

The format in which output is printed may be specified in various ways,
which broadly divide into two classes: those that find a format suitable
for the argument, and those that map the argument to fit the format.
The first class is used by routine @code{TYPE} and its aliases, as well
as by @code{PRINTF}, @code{STRING}, and @code{STR}.  The second class is
used by @code{FPRINT}, @code{FPRINTF}, and @code{FSTRING}.

Input routines are similarly divided into two classes.  Routines
@code{READ} and @code{READF} read data depending on the argument type,
and routines @code{FREAD}, @code{FREADF}, and @code{FREADS} read data
according to a specified format.

To do any kind of formatted input or output, one must be able to specify
the format that is to be used.  LUX uses format specifications which are
modeled on those from C, but with some modifications.

Format strings consist of ordinary text, format entries, and format
groupings.  All format entries are introduced by a percent sign
(@kbd{%}) and must contain a specifier character (which indicates the
type of data the format applies to).  The simplest formats contain
nothing more.

A general single format entry consists of the following components, in
the indicated order:
@enumerate
@item
a percent sign (@code{%})
@item
optional modifier characters (@ref{Format Modifiers})
@item
an optional field width (an unsigned integer number) (@ref{Format Field

@item
an optional period (@code{.})
@item
an optional precision (an unsigned integer number) (@ref{Format Precision})
@item
an optional type modifier character (@ref{Format Specifiers})
@item

@item
an optional repeat count followed by a pound sign (@code{#})

@subsection Format Specifier Characters

The format specifier consists of one character from the following
list, optionally preceded by a format type modifier (discussed below
the table).  The C format types @code{c}, @code{n}, @code{u}, and
@code{p} are not supported.  The format types @code{j}, @code{J},
@code{S}, @code{t}, @code{T}, and @code{z} are available in LUX but
not in C.

@table @code
@item d
refers to an integer (@code{LONG}) argument.  On ouput, it is
printed in decimal (base 10) notation.  On input, its base is determined
from the first character(s): initial @code{0x} or @code{0X} indicate a
hexadecimal (base 16) number; otherwise initial @code{0} indicates an
octal (base 8) number; otherwise it's a decimal (base 10) number. 
@item i
refers to an integer (@code{LONG}) argument in decimal (base 10)
notation.
@item o
refers to an integer (@code{LONG}) argument in octal (base 8) notation.
On input, an initial @code{0} is allowed.
@item x, X
refer to an integer (@code{LONG}) argument in hexadecimal (base 16)
notation, using letters @code{a} through @code{f} to denote hexadecimal
"digits" 10 through 15.  On input, initial @code{0x} or @code{0X} are
allowed.  On output, @code{%x} requests lower-case letters, and
@code{%X} requests upper-case letters.
@item e, E
refer to a floating-point (@code{FLOAT}, @code{DOUBLE}) argument in
exponential notation.  Exponential notation consists of a plus sign or
minus sign, some decimal digits, a decimal point (usually a period
@kbd{.}), more decimal digits, an @emph{exponent marker}, a plus sign or
minus sign, and some decimal digits.  The exponent marker is an @code{e}
or an @code{E}.  The part before the exponent marker is the
@emph{mantissa}, and the part after the exponent marker is the
@emph{exponent}.  The indicated number is equal to the product of the
mantissa and ten to the power of the exponent.  On output, the exponent
is always printed.  On input, the exponent, decimal point, initial sign,
and all except one digit are optional.
@item f
refers to a floating-point (@code{FLOAT}, @code{DOUBLE}) argument which
is printed in fixed-point notation (i.e., with a decimal point but no
exponent).
@item g, G
refer to a floating-point (@code{FLOAT}, @code{DOUBLE}) argument.  On
output, it is printed in exponential (@code{%e} for @code{%g}, @code{%E}
for @code{%G}) notation if the exponent is less than @minus{}4 or not
less than the precision; otherwise, fixed-point (@code{%f}) notation is
used.  On input, @code{%g} and @code{%G} work like @code{%e}.  By
default, a trailing decimal point and trailing zeros after the decimal
point are not printed.
@item J
refers to a date and time argument.  On output, the value (a
@code{FLOAT} or @code{DOUBLE}) is interpreted as a Julian Day Number
and converted to the corresponding date in the common Western
calendar; @ref{CALENDAR} for more information about calendar
transformations.  The specified precision determines how many
components of the date and time are shown, starting from the year:
@code{%.1J} provides just the year, @code{%.2J} the year and the
month, @code{%.3J} the year, month, and day, @code{%.4J} through
@code{%.6J} add the hour, minute, and second, and greater precisions
add further sexagesimal divisions of seconds.  If a width is specified
that is greater than is needed for minimal output, and if left
alignment is selected, then the last displayed component is shown with
further digits after the decimal marker until the specified width has
been filled.  @code{%.6J} yields a date and time in ISO 8601 format,
similar to @code{2000-12-30T03:04:05}.
@item s, S
refer to a @code{STRING} argument.  On output, both formats are
equivalent.  On input, the @code{%s} format does not accept whitespace
(i.e., reads one whitespace-delimited word), and the @code{%S} format
does accept whitespace except for newlines.
@item T
refers to a floating point (@code{FLOAT}, @code{DOUBLE}) argument.  On
output, it is printed with the fractional part in sexagesimal
notation, similar to @code{1234:45:56}.  The field width indicates the
minimum width of the string and the precision the number of
sexagesimal elements.  The precision defaults to 2 (i.e., hh:mm) and
cannot be less than 2.  All elements are printed as 2-digit integers,
except the last one, which is printed as a floating-point number.  The
string is lengthened (if necessary to attain the minimum field width)
by printing the last element with more digits after the decimal point.
The first element is preceded by a whitespace or a sign (depending on
the sign of the argument and the presence of the @code{+} modifier).
The @code{#} modifier (e.g., @code{%#T}) divides the argument by 15
before transforming from decimal to sexagesimal notation: it equates
360 degrees with 24 hours.
@item z
a complex (@code{CFLOAT}, @code{CDOUBLE}) number, shown as two
floating-point numbers (using a @code{%g} format, or a @code{%f} if the
format specifier is @code{%#z}) of which the first one represents the
real part, and the second one the imaginary part of the number.  The
imaginary part is always displayed with a sign, and is directly followed
by an @code{i}.  The specified width refers to the whole output, but the
specified precision applies to each of the two components separately.
@end table

@code{d i o x X} specifiers may be directly preceded by an @code{h} to
indicate a @code{WORD} argument rather than a @code{LONG} argument on
input.  @code{e E f g G t T z} specifiers may be directly preceded by an
@code{l} to indicate a @code{DOUBLE} argument rather than a @code{FLOAT}
argument on input.

If you use a format specifier that is not in this table, then strange
things may happen.

then discarded.  This allows specification of required but not used
fields in the input.
@item _

The meaning of the precision for the various format types is as follows:

@table @code
@item e, E, f
the number of digits to be printed after the decimal point. 
@item g, G
the number of significant digits to be printed.
@item z
the number of significant digits to be printed for each of the real and
imaginary parts of the value.
@item d, i, o, u, x, X
the minimum number of digits to be printed (padded with whitespace,
except when the @code{0} modifier is used, which yields padding with
zeros).
@item s, S
the maximum number of string characters to be printed.
@item t, T
the number of sexagesimal elements to print.

@subsection Format Grouping

Parts of a format string can be separated from the rest through
@emph{format grouping}.  The beginning of a format group is indicated by
@code{%(} and the end by a matching @code{%)}.  Format grouping may be
nested.  A format group end may be followed by a positive integer repeat
count and a pound sign @code{#}.

Some examples:
@example
LUX>fprint,'%(alf)2#a\n'
alfalfa
LUX>fprint,'%($%.2f %)3#combined\n',2.34,4.32,6.75
$2.34 $4.32 $6.75 combined
LUX>fprint,'x:%=d-; y:%3d\n',[1,2,3],[32,11,2]
x:1-; y:2-; y:3 32 11  2
LUX>fprint,'x:%(%=d-); y:%3d\n',[1,2,3],[32,11,2]
x:1-2-3; y: 32 11  2

@subsection Long output lines

When generating output, if LUX finds that some text to be printed to the
screen is too long to fit on the current screen line, then it looks for
good places to break the line into pieces that are short enough to each
fit on a separate line on the screen.  If the text to be printed begins
with whitespace, then LUX assumes that you prefer the text to be broken
between punctuation characters (i.e., not alphabetical or numerical or
whitespace characters) or between a non-whitespace character and
whitespace.  If the text does not begin with whitespace, then LUX
assumes that any whitespace in the text is there merely to separate
non-whitespace words, and any whitespace at the beginning of new screen
lines will be suppressed.

If filling up the screen line completely means that LUX's preferences
are not met, then LUX will back up to the last earlier location that
meets the preferences.  For this purpose, LUX assumes the screen to be
@code{!COL} characters wide.  The initial value of this variable is
taken from @code{#COL}, which itself is determined by the actual width
of your screen or text window when LUX was first started.  You cannot
change @code{#COL}, but you can set @code{!COL} to any desired value
and thereby change how wide LUX assumes the screen to be.  If you resize
the text window then you must change @code{!COL} manually to reflect the
new width.

LUX knows how newlines (@code{\n}) and carriage returns (@code{\r})
affect the cursor position, but assumes that other special characters
(such as @code{\a}, @code{\f}, and @code{\b}) as ordinary characters.
If you use special characters that do not advance the cursor by exactly
one position, then you may not get nicely formatted results.

@subsection In-Line Print Formats

@cindex In-line print formats
@cindex Output format for each data type

@code{PRINT} and its aliases and @code{PRINTF} use format system
variables by default, or in-line format strings if specified.

The format system variables are @code{!FORMAT_I}, @code{!FORMAT_F},
@code{!FORMAT_C}, and @code{!FORMAT_S}, for integers, floats, complex
numbers, and strings, respectively.  They may be set by assignment or by
routine @code{FORMAT_SET}.

A newline is printed after treatment of all arguments, except if keyword
@code{/JOIN} is specified in the call.  Unless you specify keyword
@code{/RAW}, LUX tries to avoid having a word (a sequence of
alphabetical or numerical characters) cross the right edge of the
screen (@ref{Long output lines})

A string argument which starts with one but not two percent signs is
considered an (in-line) format string.  Two inital percent signs are
reduced to one and printed.  An in-line format string may contain many
formats.  For each next argument, the next format entry (if any) will be
copied into the appropriate format symbol.  A format is maintained until
the end of the current argument list or until it is superseded by
another format from the same class (integer, float, or string).
 
Each argument takes the most recently defined format string that suits
its data type.

@subsection Output Data Formats

@cindex Output data formats
@cindex Formats for data output

@code{FPRINT}, @code{FPRINTF}, and @code{FSTRING} have a format string
as their first argument (or second in the case of @code{FPRINTF}).  Each
next argument is mapped to fit the data type requested by the next
format entry in the format string.  The last format entry is repeated as
needed to service all arguments (if there are more arguments than format
entries).  There is no implied newline printed after treatment of the
argument list: A second @code{FPRINT} starts printing where the first
one left off.

There is one format entry per argument, so all elements of an array are
printed with the same format entry.  String arguments coupled with a
number format are printed as @code{0}.  Number arguments coupled with a
string format are not printed.

LUX accepts most legal C format strings.  LUX format strings consist of
ordinary text, interspersed with format entries, which are made up of a
percent sign (@code{%}), a modifier, the minimum field width, a period
(@code{.}), the precision, and the argument type.  All but the percent
sign and the argument type are optional.  C escape sequences like
@code{\n} are handled properly (@ref{Escape Codes}).

Each format entry comprises some plain text, a %-specification, or a
%-specification with some following plain text, depending on the details
of the %-specification.

The main differences between the LUX format strings and the C format
strings are that LUX but not C features the @code{%t}, @code{%T},
@code{%S}, and @code{%z} formats and @code{_} and @code{=} format
modifiers, and that C but not LUX features @code{%n}, @code{%c}, and
@code{%p} formats.

@subsection Input Data Formats

@cindex Input data formats
@cindex Formats for data input

Routines @code{FREAD} and @code{FREADF} have a format string as their
first (for @code{FREAD}) or second (for @code{FREADF}) argument.  Each
next data value is read according to the next viable format entry in the
format string.

LUX accepts most legal C input format strings, but with some notable
exceptions.  LUX's input format strings consist of whitespace (which
matches that much or more whitespace), ordinary text, which must be
matched by the next non-whitespace input, and format entries.

Ordinarily, each input value consists of the next string of
non-whitespace characters up to the next whitespace or until the
specified field width has been reached, so that whitespace does not
count against field width.  However, if the @code{/COUNTSPACES} keyword
is specified, then LUX does count whitespace against field width.  This
format is suitable for reading data that is aligned on specific columns
but for which no field delimiters are present and for which some values
may be missing.

If the format contains explicit text to be matched but that text is not
present in the expected position in the input, then an error is
generated.

The differences between LUX input formats and C input formats are:

@enumerate
@item Initial whitespace in format specifications is ignored by LUX,
while in C it usually matches any amount of initial whitespace in the
input. 
@item Whitespace counts against field width in LUX if the
@code{/COUNTSPACES} keyword is specified.  In C and in LUX (in absence
of the @code{/COUNTSPACES} keyword) whitespace does not count against
field width.
@item LUX format @code{%S}, which reads non-newline characters, is not
available in C.
@item LUX postfices such as @code{6#}, not available in standard C,
indicate that the preceding format must be used 6 times and the result
stored in a single array (if not suppressed through the @code{*}
modifier).
@item LUX does not support the C input format @code{%u} (unsigned
integer).
@item C modifier @code{L} is not supported in LUX.
@item LUX formats @code{%t} and @code{%T} read data in sexagesimal
notation.  This format is not available in C.
@item LUX format @code{%z} reads complex numbers.  This format is not
available in C.

The format types consist of a single character from the following list. 
LUX does not support C types @code{u} (unsigned integer), @code{c}
(character). 

@table @code
@item d
Decimal integer.  @code{%hd} generates a @code{WORD}, @code{%ld} and
@code{%d} generate @code{LONG}s.
@item i
Integer, which may be decimal, octal (leading @code{0}), or hexadecimal
(leading @code{0x} or @code{0X}).  @code{%hi} generates a @code{WORD},
@code{%li} and @code{%i} generate @code{LONG}s.
@item o
Octal integer.  @code{%ho} generates a @code{WORD}, @code{%lo} and
@code{%o} generate @code{LONG}s.
@item x
Hexadecimal integer.  @code{%hx} generates a @code{WORD}, @code{%lx} and
@code{%x} generate @code{LONG}s. 
@item e, f, g
Floating-point numbers, consisting of an optional sign, a string of
numbers containing an optional decimal point, and an optional exponent
field containing an @code{e} or @code{E} and an optionally signed
integer exponent.  @code{%e}, @code{%f}, and @code{%g} generate
@code{FLOAT}s, @code{%le}, @code{%lf}, and @code{%lg} generate
@code{DOUBLE}s. 
@item s
A string consisting of the next non-whitespace characters (up to the
field width).  The result may be shorter than the field width, if
whitespace or the end of the string intervene.  If no field width is
specified, then the next non-whitespace word is returned.
@item S
A string consisting of the next non-newline characters (up to the field
width).
@item [...]
Matches the longest non-empty string of input characters from the set
between brackets.  If you want to include @code{]} in the set, then
place it directly after the initial @code{[}.  Use a minus sign to
indicate a range of characters, e.g. @code{0-9} for @code{0} through
@code{9}.  If you want to include a minus sign itself, then make it the
last element before the closing @code{]}.
@item [^...]
Matches the longest non-empty string of input characters that are not in
the set between brackets.  If you want to include @code{]} in the set,
then place it directly after the initial @code{[^}.  For the rest,
similar to @code{[...]}
@item t, T
A number in sexagesimal notation (e.g., times in hours, minutes, and
seconds, or angles in degrees, minutes, and seconds).  The number
consists of two or more numerical components separated by any amount of
non-digits.  Only the first numerical component may be signed.  All but
the last numerical component must be integers; the last one may be
floating-point (with a decimal point and/or exponent).  The first
numerical component counts units and each next numerical component
counts 1/60th as much as the previous one.
@item z
A number in complex notation, consisting of an optionally signed
floating-point number followed by a signed floating-point number
followed by an @code{i} or @code{I}.  The first number indicates the
real part, and the second number the complex part of the result.
@item %
Literal @code{%}.  No assignment is made.

Some byte values do not have an associated printable character; for
example, the "newline" and "return" characters.  Program code cannot
contain non-printable characters.  To allow such characters to yet be
included in programs, C-style @emph{escape codes} can be used.  An
escape code is introduced by a backslash @code{\}.  The following escape
codes are recognized by LUX:

@table @code
@item \a
stands for the "audible bell" character, which when printed may produce
an audible signal, such as a beep.
@item \b
stands for the "backspace" character, which when printed makes the
cursor go one position to the left.
@item \f
stands for the "formfeed" character, which when printed makes the cursor
go down to the next page.
@item \n
stands for the "newline" character, which when printed makes the cursor
go to the beginning of the next line.
@item \r
stands for the "carriage return" character, which when printed makes the
cursor go to the beginning of the current line.
@item \t
stands for the "horizontal tab" character, which when printed makes the
cursor go to the next horizontal tab stop position.
@item \v
stands for the "vertical tab" character, which when printed makes the
cursor go to the next vertical tab stop position.
@item \\
stands for a single backslash @code{\} character.
@item \?
stands for a question mark @code{?} character.
@item \'
stands for a single quote @code{'} character.
@item \"
stands for a double quote @code{"} character.
@item \ooo
with "ooo" equal to one, two, or three octal digits: stands for a
character whose value is equal to the indicated octal number.
@item \xhh

@chapter Syntax

@cindex Syntax of LUX
@cindex LUX syntax
@cindex LUX grammar
@cindex Grammar of LUX

This chapter contains a schematic specification of the language syntax
of LUX.  All valid LUX code can be expressed in terms of the following
specification.  The specification consists of a number of rules.  The
word on the left-hand side of the first colon of each rule indicates the
name of the rule, and the text following the colon specify the valid
forms of the rule, separated by vertical bars (|).  Lower-case words
indicate names of other rules.  Upper-case words indicate key LUX syntax
words (such as @code{FOR} and @code{ELSE}) or names of types of
expressions that can appear at those points (such as @code{FILENAME} or
@code{NUMBER}), or the expression @code{(empty)} which means no input,
or @code{C_ID}, which stands for a common identifier (one starting with
an alphabetic character), or @code{S_ID}, which stands for a special
identifier (one starting with one character out of @code{! $ #}).  Other
characters are expected in the input at the indicated positions.  By
starting at the very first rule (the one named @code{lines}) and
successively replacing rule names by one of their valid forms you can
end up with any valid piece of LUX code.  However, not all possible
output of this set of rules yields valid LUX code: whether some code is
valid depends also on the classes and contents of the variables and
expressions, which is not taken into account in these rules.

An expression is a single value or set of values, or a combination of
several values through an operator such as addition or multiplication,
or through a function call to functions such as the sine function or the
averaging function.

Expressions belong to specific @emph{data classes}, such as scalar,
string, or array, and their value can be stored in a variable.

@cindex Variables
@cindex Named variables

A variable is a name to which a value can be assigned.  In LUX, whenever
you assign a value to a variable, the variable takes on the data class
and type of the value you assigned to it (with the exception of pointer
variables (see @ref{Pointers}).  So, the set of assignments
@example
@code{@var{x}} = 17.3
@code{@var{x}} = 'Jabberwocky'
@end example
first makes variable @code{@var{x}} be a @code{FLOAT}, and then a @code{STRING}.

Names of variables must start with a letter or one of the characters
@kbd{$ ! #}.  Following characters in the names of variables must be
letters, digits, or the character @kbd{_}.  Variables are either local
or global.

Reserved keywords cannot be used as names of variables.

@subsection Local Variables

@cindex Local variables
@cindex Variables local to a routine/function

A variable whose name starts with a letter is a @emph{local} variable.
Its scope is limited to the current context (user-defined subroutine or
function, or the main level).  A particular variable that you define at
the main level of execution (i.e., at the @samp{LUX>} prompt) is not
known inside a user-defined subroutine or function.  Likewise, a
variable that you define inside a particular user-defined subroutine or
function is not known inside any other subroutine or function, or at the
main execution level.  This means that you can have different variables
with different values but the same name in different contexts.  You can
define a variable @code{x} at the main execution level, another @code{x}
inside your subroutine @code{MYSUB}, and another @code{x} inside your
subroutine @code{DOTHIS}, and all of these variables will be distinct.

You can access variables inside a subroutine or function from outside
that subroutine or function by prepending the name of the subroutine or
function and a period (@kbd{.}) to the name of the variable.  In this
case the subroutine or function acts like a structure variable
(@ref{Structures}).  For instance, to inspect from the main execution
level the variable @code{x} inside your subroutine @code{MYSUB}, type
the following:

@example
T,mysub.x
@end example

Of course, inside the subroutine the variable is called just @code{x}.
This procedure does not work for parameters of user-defined functions
and subroutines: their value is lost when the routine is finished.

@subsection Global Variables

@cindex Global variables
@cindex Variables, global

A variable whose name starts with one of @kbd{$ ! #} is a @emph{global}
variable: It is available to the user in any context, at the main
execution level, inside user-defined subroutines, and inside
user-defined functions.

Some variables whose names start with a @kbd{#} are predefined read-only
variables.  The user cannot change their value.  These variables contain
constants of nature and the like.  For instance, @code{#PI} returns the
value of pi, the ratio between the circumference and the radius of a
circle in a plane (see @ref{#PI}).

The user can create more global variables whose names start with a
@kbd{#}.  These additional variables are global, their value can be
changed, and they can be deleted again.

Variables whose names start with a @kbd{!} are predefined global
variables.  The user cannot create such variables.  These variables come
in two flavors.  One set is linked to one or more specific subroutines
or functions and either govern some aspect of their behavior, or are
assigned some value by the subroutine or function.  This set of
variables is only important if the corresponding subroutine or function
is called, and their value can be modified by the user.  For instance,
@code{!LASTMAX} returns the maximum value that was found during the most
recent call to any of the functions @code{MIN}, @code{MAX},
@code{MINLOC}, or @code{MAXLOC} (see @ref{!LASTMAX}, @ref{MIN},
@ref{MAX}, @ref{MINLOC}, @ref{MAXLOC}), and @code{!FFTDP} determines if
FFTs are performed in single or double precision.

Variables in the second set are @emph{status functions}, and they are
not linked to any (other) subroutine or function.  They generally
require system I/O during their evaluation and generally yield a
different value each time they are inspected.  For example, @code{!TIME}
returns a string containing the current time (see @ref{!TIME}).

Variables whose names start with a @kbd{$} are read-write global
variables.  No such variables are predefined, and the user can create,
modify, and delete such variables just like any local variable.

@subsection Reserved Keywords

@cindex Reserved keywords
@cindex Words, reserved

A number of words are reserved by LUX to indicate certain LUX language
features.  The list of reserved words is the following:

@code{AND}, @code{ANDIF}, @code{BEGIN}, @code{BLOCK}, @code{BREAK},
@code{CASE}, @code{COMPILEIF}, @code{CONTINUE}, @code{DO},
@code{ELSE}, @code{END}, @code{ENDBLOCK}, @code{ENDCASE},
@code{ENDCIF}, @code{ENDFUNC}, @code{ENDSUBR}, @code{EQ}, @code{FOR},
@code{FUNC}, @code{GE}, @code{GT}, @code{IF}, @code{LE}, @code{LT},
@code{MOD}, @code{NCASE}, @code{NE}, @code{OR}, @code{ORIF},
@code{REPEAT}, @code{RETALL}, @code{RETURN}, @code{RUN}, @code{SMOD},
@code{SUBR}, @code{THEN}, @code{UNTIL}, @code{WHILE}, @code{XOR}

These words (in any combination of upper case and lower case letters)
cannot be used as names for variables, user-defined subroutines, or
functions, and will generate errors when used as such.  They can be used
as part of literal strings (i.e., @code{t,'break'} is OK; @code{t,break}
is not).

In addition, the words @code{IGNORE} and @code{RESUME} are similarly
reserved if they occur as the first word on a line.  They can be used as
named for variables or routines as long as they do not appear as the
first word on a line.  See @ref{Ignoring Input} for more information.

A @code{SCALAR} is a single number.  The more digits you wish to specify
for a number, the more memory space is required to store that number.
To make efficient use of the limited amount of memory that is available,
LUX offers different numerical @emph{data types}, which offer greater or
smaller ranges of numbers, and so require greater or smaller amounts of
memory for storage.

LUX allows specification of integer numbers in octal (base 8), decimal
(base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) formats, and floating-point numbers
in decimal and restricted sexagesimal (base 60) notation.  In addition,
LUX allows specification of complex numbers.

@cindex INT value
@cindex LONG value
@cindex FLOAT value

LUX offers the following numerical data types:
@table @code
@item BYTE
A @code{BYTE} number requires one byte of storage, and can have any
integer value between 0 and 255 (@code{#MAX_BYTE} -- @ref{#MAX_BYTE} --
inclusive). 
@ifinfo
(2^8 - 1),
@end ifinfo
@tex
$2^8-1$,

@ifinfo
(2^15 - 1),
@end ifinfo
@tex
($2^{15}-1$),
@end tex
inclusive.

@item LONG
A @code{LONG} number requires four bytes of storage, and can have any
integer value between @minus{}2147483648 (@code{#MIN_LONG} --
@ref{#MIN_LONG}) and +2147483647 (@code{#MAX_LONG} -- @ref{#MAX_LONG})
@ifinfo
(2^31 - 1),
@end ifinfo
@tex
($2^{31}-1$),
@end tex
inclusive.

@item FLOAT
A @code{FLOAT} number requires four bytes of storage, and has a
single-precision floating-point value.  The meaning of "single
precision" depends on the way that floating-point numbers are
represented inside your computer.  On all computers, these values have
at least 6 significant digits, and may have a magnitude at least as
large as 
@ifinfo
10^37
@end ifinfo
@tex
$10^{37}$
@end tex
and at least as small as (when larger than zero)
@ifinfo
10^-37.
@end ifinfo
@tex
$10^{-37}$.
@end tex
The largest absolute value representable on your machine as a
@code{FLOAT} is equal to @code{#MAX_FLOAT} (@ref{#MAX_FLOAT}).  The
smallest representable non-zero absolute value is equal to
@code{#MIN_FLOAT} (@ref{#MIN_FLOAT}).

On machines that comply with the IEEE 754-1985 standard for binary
floating-point arithmetic, values of type @code{FLOAT} may have the
value zero and also values between about
@ifinfo
7*10^-46 (2^-150)
@end ifinfo
@tex
$7\cdot{}10^{-46} (2^{-150})$
@end tex
and
@ifinfo
3*10^38 (2^128),
@end ifinfo
@tex
$3\cdot{}10^{38} (2^{128})$,
@end tex
as well as the special values @code{Inf} (too large for this data
type) and @code{NaN} (Not-A-Number, for undefined results such as the
square root of a negative number; see @ref{ISNAN}).

@item DOUBLE
A @code{DOUBLE} number requires eight bytes of storage, and has a
double-precision floating-point value.  As for @code{FLOAT} values, the
precision reached depends on your computer.  These values have at least
10 significant digits, and have a range of magnitudes at least as large
as that of a @code{FLOAT} value.  The largest and smallest representable
absolute non-zero values of type @code{DOUBLE} are @code{#MAX_DOUBLE}
(@ref{#MAX_DOUBLE}) and @code{#MIN_DOUBLE} (@ref{#MIN_DOUBLE}).

On computers that comply with the IEEE 754-1985 standard for binary
floating-point arithmetic, values of type @code{DOUBLE} may have the
value zero and also values between about
@ifinfo
1*10^-308 (2^-1075)
@end ifinfo
@tex
$10^{-308} (2^{-1075})$
@end tex
and
@ifinfo
4*10^308 (2^1025),

$4\cdot{}10^{308} (2^{1025})$,
@end tex
as well as the special values @code{Inf} (too large for this data
type) and @code{NaN} (Not-A-Number, for undefined results such as the
square root of a negative number).
@end table

On computers that comply with the IEEE 754-1985 standard, the ratio
@code{1.0/0.0} yields the value @code{Inf} (infinity), and that value is
available in the global variable @code{#INFTY}.  On computers that do
not allow division by (floating-point) zero, @code{#INFTY} is equal to
@code{#MAX_FLOAT}.

@cindex Base 8 numbers
@cindex Base 10 numbers
@cindex Base 16 numbers
@cindex Octal numbers
@cindex Decimal numbers
@cindex Hexadecimal numbers
@cindex B at end of hexadecimal numbers

Integer numbers can be specified in three bases, as follows:

@table @asis
@item base 8 (octal).
A set of octal digits followed by @code{o} or @code{O} specifies a
number in base 8.  For example, @code{17o} is equal to 1*8+7 = 15 in
base 10.

@item base 10 (decimal).
A set of decimal digits (@kbd{0-9}) specifies a number in base 10.

@item base 16 (hexadecimal).
A set of hexadecimal digits (@kbd{0-9, a-f, A-F}) preceded by @kbd{0x}
or @kbd{0X}, specifies a number in base 16.  For example, @kbd{0x3a},
and @kbd{0X3A} all specify the same number in base 16, which is equal to
3*16+10 = 58 in base 10.
@end table

By default, an integer number is assumed to have data type @code{LONG}
(see @ref{Numerical Data Types}).  A non-hexadecimal number can be
specified to be @code{BYTE} by appending a @code{b} or @code{B} to the
number.  A number in any base is specified to be of type @code{WORD} by
appending a @code{w} or @code{W}.  Data type @code{LONG} can be
specified explicitly by appending an @code{l} or @code{L}.  For example,
@code{17} and @code{17L} have data type @code{LONG}, @code{17b} is
@code{BYTE}, and @code{17w} is @code{WORD}.

The data type specification, if any, follows the base specification, if
any.  The @code{bB} specifier is disallowed for hexadecimal numbers to
prevent confusion between a final hexadecimal digit @code{B} and the
@code{BYTE} type specifier.

NOTE: With LUX version 3.1.86, the principle has been adopted that the
legality of a character as part of a number specification must be
determinable from that character and perhaps the directly following
character, but not more.  This means that the method of identifying
hexadecimal numbers by appending an @code{X} is now disallowed.

Also, use of the @code{B} data type specifier on hexadecimal numbers was
disallowed starting with LUX version 3.1.86.

@subsubsection Floating-Point Numbers

@cindex Floating-point numbers
@cindex Single precision floating-point numbers
@cindex Double precision floating-point numbers
@cindex Base 60 numbers
@cindex Sexagesimal numbers

Floating-point numbers can be specified in single or double precision
(@ref{Numerical Data Types}), and also in sexagesimal format (see
below).  The following specification of a single-precision
floating-point number (of data type @code{FLOAT}) is of the most general
type available: @code{6.4e-3}.  An upper-case @code{E} may be used
instead of the lower-case @code{e}.  The number following the @code{e}
or @code{E} is the @emph{exponent}, and the number before the @code{e}
or @code{E} is the @emph{mantissa}.  The exponent indicates by what
power of ten the mantissa is to be multiplied.  The current example
involves the number 6.4 divided by 1,000.

The following specifications, which lack parts of the general format,
are also legal for single-precision floating-point numbers:
@code{0.023}, @code{.5}, @code{11.}, @code{7E+3}, @code{17e}.  The first
three examples lack an exponent, but are still @code{FLOAT} because a
decimal point was specified.  The third example lacks a decimal point,
but is still @code{FLOAT} because an exponent is present.  Note that a
plus sign is allowed (but not necessary) in the exponent.  The fourth
example lacks both a decimal point and an exponent, but is still
@code{FLOAT} because the @code{e} marker is present.

Double-precision floating-point numbers (data type @code{DOUBLE}) are
specified like single-precision numbers, except that the @code{e} or
@code{E} marker is replaced by a @code{d} or @code{D} marker, and this
marker must be present in any explicit specification of a
double-precision number.

A floating-point number can be specified in restricted sexagesimal
notation, for instance @code{23s33:32:11.3}.  The @code{s} flags
sexagesimal interpretation; a decimal number precedes it, and zero or
more colon-separated decimal numbers and an optional final
floating-point number may follow.  The first number counts units of 1,
and each next number counts units that are 1/60th as large as the
previous one.  The final number must not have an exponent, though one
character from @code{dDeE} may follow to indicate @code{FLOAT}
(@code{eE}) or @code{DOUBLE} (@code{dD}) data type.  Besides @code{s},
also @code{S}, @code{h} or @code{H} may be used to indicate sexagesimal
notation.  The @code{S} is equivalent to @code{s}, and the @code{h} and
@code{H} indicate that the result must be multiplied by 15, transforming
hours to degrees, so that @code{24h} is equivalent to @code{360}.

NOTE: The use of the @code{s} and @code{h} specifiers for sexagesimal
numbers is new, starting with LUX version 3.1.89.  Before, colons were
used instead of @code{sS}, and no @code{hH} transformation was
available.

@subsubsection Complex Numbers

@cindex complex numbers
@cindex numbers, complex
@cindex imaginary numbers

Complex numbers consist of two parts, called the @emph{real} part and
the @emph{imaginary} part.  A complex number that has no imaginary part
is called a real number; A complex number that has no real part is
called an imaginary number.  Any imaginary number can be written as the
product of a real number and the @emph{imaginary unit}.  The imaginary
unit is generally denoted @code{i} in mathematical notation and @code{j}
in engineering texts, and is available in LUX as read-only variable
@code{#I}, and as suffix @code{i} or @code{I} on any non-imaginary
number: @code{2*#I} and @code{2i} are two ways of expressing twice the
imaginary unit.  The imaginary unit is defined such that
@code{#I^2 = -1}.

Complex numbers come in two data types: complex float (@code{CFLOAT}),
and complex double (@code{CDOUBLE}).  @code{CDOUBLE} is explicitly
indicated by use of the @code{D} specifier (for @code{DOUBLE}) and the
@code{I} specifier (for imaginary).

@subsection Strings

@cindex Strings
@cindex Literal text
@cindex Quotes

A @code{STRING} is a sequence of arbitrary characters.  A string may
have any (nonnegative integer) length, and takes one byte of storage for
each character.  A string is explicitly specified by enclosing the
characters of the string between single right-hand quotes or between
double quotes, like so:

@example
'a string'
"another string"
@end example

Such an explicit string specification is called a @emph{literal string}.
An empty literal string is specified by two single or double quotes, as
follows:

@example
''
""
@end example

The kind of quote character that introduced the string is referred to as
the @emph{active quote character}.  Within a string delimited by one
kind of quotes, the inactive other kind is treated as a regular
character.  For example:

@example
LUX>t,"It's wonderful!"
It's wonderful!
LUX>
@end example

If you insist on specifying an active quote character as explicit part
of a literal string, then include a pair of such quote characters, as
illustrated by the following example:

@example
LUX>t,'It''s wonderful!'
It's wonderful!
LUX>
@end example

All C-style escape sequences are honored in literal strings.  For
example, @code{\n} inside a literal string is replaced by the newline
character.  All such escape sequences start with a backslash @kbd{\}.
The recognized escape sequences are:

@table @asis
@item \n
A newline character.
@item \t
A horizontal tab character.
@item \v
A vertical tab character.
@item \b
A backspace character.
@item \r
A carriage return character.
@item \f
A form feed character.
@item \a
A bell (audible alert) character.
@item \\
A backslash (@kbd{\}) character.
@item \?
A question mark (@kbd{?}) character.
@item \'
A single quote (@kbd{'}) character.
@item \"
A double quote (@kbd{"}) character.
@item \ooo
The character indicated by the specified octal code (in place of the
@kbd{ooo}) in the native character set of your computer.  The octal
number may have up to three characters: the greatest number up to
three is taken that yields a valid octal number. 
@item \xhh
The character indicated by the specified hexadecimal code (in place of
the @kbd{hh}) in the native character set of your computer.  The
hexadecimal number may have any number of hexadecimal digits.  The
greatest number is taken that yields a valid hexadecimal number, but
you may get unexpected results if you specify more than two of them.
@end table

Internally, these escape sequences are replaced by a byte code that
uniquely identifies them, just as happens to ordinary characters.  O

most if not all computers, newline means "go to the start of the next
line", carriage return means "go to the start of the current line", and
backspace means "go one position closer to the start of the current line
without deleting the current character".  One can extract parts of a
string by using subscripts (@ref{Subscripts}).

@subsubsection Specifying Arrays

@cindex Specifying arrays
@cindex Arrays, specifying
@cindex Numerical arrays, specifying
@cindex String arrays, specifying

One-dimensional numerical arrays can be specified explicitly by listing
the elements, separated by commas, and enclosed between square brackets,
as shown in the following example:

@example
@code{@var{x}} = [ 5, 7, 13.0, 23 ]
@end example

The data type (see @ref{Numerical Data Types}) of such a numerical array
is the highest data type present among the elements in its
specification, in the order @code{BYTE}, @code{WORD}, @code{LONG},
@code{FLOAT} (@code{CFLOAT}), @code{DOUBLE} (@code{CDOUBLE}).  If any of
the elements are complex, then the array will be complex, too.  The
array in the example has data type @code{FLOAT}.

One-dimensional string arrays can be specified in the same way as
numerical arrays are, by combining the string
components.  For instance, 
@example
@code{@var{s}} = ['Jill', 'John', 'Joan', 'Jerry Lee Lewis']
@end example
generates a string array with four elements.

Arrays with a specific dimensional structure and data type but elements
that are not set to any particular value can be created through the
functions @code{BYTARR}, @code{INTARR}, @code{LONARR}, @code{FLTARR},
@code{DBLARR}, @code{CFLTARR}, @code{CDBLARR}, @code{STRARR}, and
@code{ARRAY} (@ref{ARRAY}).  For 
instance, 
@example
@code{x} = FLTARR(200,100)
@end example
creates a @code{FLOAT} array with dimensions 200 by 100, with undefined
elements; i.e., the elements get whatever values happen to be in the
memory slots that the elements are assigned to.  You can fill the array
with specific values through, for instance, the @code{ZERO}, @code{ONE},
and @code{INDGEN} functions (@ref{ZERO}, @ref{ONE}, @ref{INDGEN}).

It is quite easy to request an array that is so large that not enough
room for it is available in your computer, or even so large that the
number of its bytes does not fit in any integer number type that is
available on your computer.  For example, you can request an array with
6 dimensions that are each equal to one million (e.g., through @code{N =
1000000 X = BYTARR(N,N,N,N,N,N)}); such an array is @emph{very much}
bigger than would fit in all the computer memory that exists today in
the whole world.  LUX generates an error message if you request an array
that is too big.

Arrays can be combined into a single, bigger array through the
@code{CONCAT} (@ref{CONCAT}) or @code{[]} (@ref{Square Brackets})
functions, if each dimension but the last is the same in all component
arrays.  In this function, a scalar is treated as a one-dimensional
array with only one element.  For instance, we can combine a 3-element
array with a scalar to get a 4-element array.  The following two
assignments yield the same result:
@example
x = [[3, 4, 5], 12]
x = [3, 4, 5, 12]
@end example

Arrays can be endowed with an extra dimension by applying the
@code{CONCAT} or @code{[]} function to that array alone.  For instance,
@example
y = [[3, 4, 5]]
@end example
defines a two-dimensional array, with dimensions 3 by 1.  Also legal are
the following assignments:
@example
z = [y, y]
a = [z, y]
@end example
which define a 3-by-2 and a 3-by-3 array, respectively.

@subsection File Arrays

@cindex File arrays
@cindex Arrays, file
@cindex Disk file arrays

A @code{FILE ARRAY} is a variable that assigns an array type and
structure to a disk file, so that you can access and modify the disk
file as if it were an @code{ARRAY} (see @ref{Arrays}).  Since
interaction with disk files takes longer than interaction with internal
memory, working with file arrays is slower than working with ordinary
arrays.  However, ordinary arrays are limited in size by the size of
your work memory, whereas file arrays are limited in size by the size of
your hard disk, which is usually much bigger.

You create a file array by using one of the functions @code{BYTFARR},
@code{INTFARR}, @code{LONFARR}, @code{FLTFARR}, @code{DBLFARR},
@code{CFLTFARR}, or @code{CDBLFARR}.  (See @ref{BYTFARR}, @ref{INTFARR},
@ref{LONFARR}, @ref{FLTFARR}, @ref{DBLFARR}, @ref{CFLTFARR}, and
@ref{CDBLFARR}.)  For instance:
@example
@code{z} = FLTFARR('file.dat',200,100)
@end example
creates a @code{FLOAT} file array with dimensions 200 by 100, associated
with file @file{file.dat}.  If the file does not exist yet, then it is
created the first time you write data to it.  You use a file array just
like an ordinary array, except that the @code{+} summation flag is not
(yet) implemented for file arrays.

File arrays assume that the data values in the disk file have the byte
order that is appropriate for the current computer system.  FZ files are
always stored in little-endian order, so file arrays reading from FZ
files currently only works on little-endian machines.

@subsection Associated Variables

@cindex Associated variables
@cindex Variables, associated with disk file
@cindex Disk file associated variables

An associated variable links a record with a particular array structure
to a logical unit, and allows access to and modification of the file
opened on the logical unit (if any) by records.  No file need be opened
on the logical unit when the associated variable is created.

Create an associated variable with function @code{ASSOC} (@ref{ASSOC}).
For instance:
@example
@code{@var{z}} = ASSOC(1, FLTARR(200,300))
@end example
associates a record with the structure of a @code{FLOAT} @code{ARRAY} of
200 by 300 elements with logical unit number 1.  After such an
assignment, @code{@var{z}(@code{@var{i}})} refers to the @code{@var{i}}th record (of
200 by 300 @code{FLOAT} elements) in the file linked to logical unit 1.

@subsection Ranges

@cindex Ranges

A @code{RANGE} is a variable that combines two values.  Ranges are
designed for indicating the start and end of index ranges in subscripts
(@ref{Range Subscripts}), but can be used to hold any kind of data.  A
range variable is defined as follows:

@example
r = (r1:r2)
@end example

In this example, the variables @code{r1} and @code{r2} are the "start"
and the "end" of the range, respectively.  The only operations that can
be performed on ranges other than scalar ranges (see below) are
assignment and extraction of elements.

A scalar range is a range that contains only scalars.  For scalar
ranges, a special notation is available for counting from the end of the
index range.  In either field of a scalar range, @code{@var{expr}}
stands for "count @code{@var{expr}} from the beginning of the index
range", and @code{* - @code{@var{expr}}} stands for "count
@code{@var{expr}} backwards from one beyond the end of the index range".
For instance, if one-dimensional array @code{x} has ten elements, then
@code{x(3:5)} selects the elements with indices 3, 4, and 5, and
@code{x(3:*-3)} selects the elements with indices 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  A
single asterisk @code{*} in either field is equivalent with @code{* -
1}.

If only one field is specified but this field contains a @code{*} or
@code{* - @var{expr}} expression, then the variable is treated as a
@code{RANGE} variable.  A single asterisk * indicates the full range and
is equivalent to @code{(0:*)}.  The @code{* - @var{expr}} notation is
equivalent to a range with both fields equal to the specified one.  Such
a range selects only a single element.  When used inside a subscript,
the parentheses can be left off, and two more fields may be added to the
range (@ref{Range Subscripts}).

You can refer to the first two fields of a range variable by appending a
subscript @code{0} (for the first field) or @code{1} (for the last
field) between parentheses @kbd{()}.  For instance, if @code{r} is the
range @code{(10:20)}, then @code{r(0)} is equal to @code{10} and
@code{r(1)} is equal to @code{20}.  If the selected field contains a
@code{* - @var{expr}} entry, then @code{@var{expr}} is returned.  For
instance, if @code{r = (10:*-5)}, then @code{r(1)} yields @code{5}.

You can assign new values to the first two fields of a range variable,
but you cannot change the field's format from ordinary to @code{*} or
the other way around: you have to replace the whole range to achieve
that.  For instance, if @code{r = (10:*-5)}, then @code{r(1) = 3}
changes the value of @code{r} to @code{(10:*-3)}.  To change to
@code{(10:20)}, do @code{r = (10:20)}.  Addition and subtraction
involving ranges act to shift the range over the indicated amount.  For
instance, if @code{r = (10:*-5)}, then @code{r + 2} yields
@code{(12:*-3)}.  Multiplication and division act on each of the range
ends separately, so @code{2*r} yields @code{(20:*-10)}.

@subsection Compact Lists of Variables

@cindex Compact Lists
@cindex Sets of expressions
@cindex Groups of expressions

A @emph{compact list} (@code{CLIST}) is a collection of arbitrary values
or variables of arbitrary classes and data types.  Any combination of
data classes and types can be put in a compact list.  A compact list is
a restricted version of a full list (@ref{Lists}).  Any list without
keywords is automatically transformed into a compact list.  A compact
list is created by listing the elements, separated by commas and
enclosed in curly braces.  For example,
@example
x = @{ [22, 12, 3.0], 'computers can be fun', (6:23) @}
y = @{ 'Alpha Centauri', 4.3, 'lightyears' @}
@end example
defines two compact lists.  List @code{x} combines a @code{FLOAT}
@code{ARRAY} (@ref{Arrays}), a @code{STRING} (@ref{Strings}), and a
@code{RANGE} expression (@ref{Ranges}), and list @code{y} combines a
@code{STRING}, a @code{SCALAR} (@ref{Scalars}), and another
@code{STRING}.

You can specify a compact list without any elements, as @code{@{@}}.

One can combine different compact lists and other elements into a single
compact list, or into a compact list of lists and other things.
Concatenation using curly braces (@{@}) preserves the structure of all
concatenated elements, whereas concatenation using square brackets ([])
removes the outermost grouping from compact lists, similar to how array
concatenation works.

For instance,
@example
q = [ x, y ]
q = @{ [22, 12, 3.0], 'computers can be fun', (6:23), 'Alpha Centauri',
       4.3, 'lightyears' @}
@end example
are equivalent definitions of a @code{CLIST} with all elements of
@code{x} and all elements of @code{y} as its elements.  In contrast to
this,
@example
u = @{ x, y @}
@end example
defines a compact list with just two elements: The first element is
compact list @code{x}, and the second element is compact list @code{y}.

One refers to a particular element of a compact list by subscript.  For
example, @code{q(1)}, and @code{u(0)(1)} both refer to the string
@code{'computers can be fun'}.  One can extract more than one element
from a compact list using subscripts, just as for arrays (@ref{Arrays}).
The subscripts may be scalars, ranges, or arrays of indices.

Lists can be used to specify arbitrary number of subscripts to functions
or expressions.  @ref{Lists of Subscripts}.

Lists are collections of arbitrary values or variables of arbitrary
classes and data types.  Any combination of data classes and types can
be put in a list.  Each element of a list can have a name tag associated
with it, unlike compact lists (@ref{Compact Lists}).

One specifies a list by listing its elements, separated by commas, and
enclosed in curly braces.  Each element of a list consists of either
just a value, or of a name tag followed by a colon and the value.  For
instance,
@example
a = @{ NAME: 'Alpha Centauri, DISTANCE: 4.3, UNIT: 'lightyears' @}
b = @{ NUMBER: 17, 3.2 @}
@end example
defines a list @code{a} with name tags associated with all values, and a
list @code{b} with a name tag only for the first element.  Values inside
a list need not have an associated name tag, but lists with no name tags
at all associated with their elements are automatically transformed into
@code{LIST}s.

One can combine different lists and other symbols into a single list, or
into a list of lists and other things.  Concatenation using curly braces
(@code{@{@}}) preserves the list of all concatenated elements, whereas
concatenation using square brackets (@code{[]}) removes the outermost
grouping from lists (both compact and regular), similar to how array
concatenation works (@ref{Arrays}).

For instance,
@example
q = [ a, b ]
q = @{ NAME: 'Alpha Centauri, DISTANCE: 4.3, UNIT: 'lightyears',
NUMBER: 17, 3.2 @}
@end example
are equivalent definitions of @code{q}, whereas @code{u = @{ FIRST: a, b
@}} defines a list @code{u} with two elements which are themselves
lists, too.

One can refer to a particular element of a list by subscript, as for
compact lists, or by name tag.  For example, @code{z(1)} and
@code{z.DISTANCE} both refer to the number 4.3.  One can extract more
than one element from a list using subscripts, just as for compact lists
and arrays (@ref{Arrays}).

Lists can be used to specify arbitrary number of subscripts to functions
or expressions.  @ref{Lists of Subscripts}.

Lists were a late addition to LUX.  By the time they were added, two LUX
read-only constants @code{#R.D} and @code{#D.R} (@ref{#R.D}, @ref{#D.R})
were already in widespread use with names that contained a period.
Disallowing these two names would force all programs that already
contained them to be changed, so these names are retained as the only
exception to the rule that two text strings separated by a period
indicate a member of a list.  Their use is discouraged, however, in
favor of @code{#DEG} and @code{#RAD} (@ref{#DEG}, @ref{#RAD}) which
serve the same purpose but do not contain periods.

@subsection Pointers to Variables and Routines

@cindex Pointers to other variables
@cindex Other variables, pointers to

There are two kinds of @code{POINTER}s: A variable pointer points at
another variable, and a function pointer points at a function or
routine.  Pointers act as aliases of whatever they point at.  Define a
pointer by prefixing an ampersand @kbd{&} to the name of the entity it
is to point at, or by using the routine @code{POINTER} (@ref{POINTER}).
For example, pointers to a variable @code{y} and a function @code{SIN}
are defined as follows:
@example
y = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
z = &y
q = &SIN
POINTER, r, y
@end example

A variable pointer shares the data memory of the entity it points at.
If you assign a value to a variable pointer or to the entity it points
at, then the change is reflected in the other member of the pair as
well.  For instance, after the above assignments @code{y(1)},
@code{z(1)}, and @code{r(1)} all yield the value 2, and after the
assignment @code{y = 17}, all three refer to the value 17.

A function pointer acts in every way like the function or routine it
points at.  For instance, with the assignments mentioned above,
@code{SIN(1)} and @code{q(1)} both yield the same result.

If you use @code{DELETE,z} on pointer @code{z} defined above, then
@code{z} still points at @code{y}, but now @code{y} has data class
@code{UNDEFINED} (@ref{Undefined}).  If you use @code{ZAP,z}, then
@code{y} is removed completely, and pointer @code{z} points at nothing.
To break the link between the pointer and whatever it points at, use
@code{DELETE,/POINTER,z}.  This command makes @code{z} undefined, but
leaves whatever @code{z} pointed at unchanged.  To remove pointer
@code{z} completely, use @code{ZAP,/POINTER,z}.  This, too, leaves
whatever @code{z} pointed at unchanged.  To merely change the target of
the pointer, use the @code{POINTER} routine.

Binary arithmetical operators are defined for @code{SCALAR}s (both real

the range elements are numerical), and addition is also defined for
@code{STRING}s.  The operator goes between the two operands.  The data
type of the result is equal to the highest data type present among the
operands, except where noted.  There is no implicit conjugation when
multiplying or dividing complex numbers.

The available binary operators are:
@table @asis
@item Addition
@code{x + y} adds the values of @code{x} and @code{y} (if they are
numerical) or concatenates the values (if they are @code{STRI

@item Subtraction
@code{x - y} subtracts the value of @code{y} from the value of
@code{x}.

@item Multiplication
@code{x * y} multiplies the values of @code{x} and @code{y}.

@item Matrix multiplication
@code{x # y} multiplies matrix @code{x} and matrix @code{y}.  See
@ref{MPRODUCT}.

@item Division
@code{x / y} divides the value of @code{x} by the value of @code{y}.  If
@code{x} and @code{y} are both integer, then only the integer part
of the division is returned.

@item Power-taking
@code{x ^ y} raises @code{x} to the power @code{y}.  The result is
always of a floating-point data type.

@item Modulus
@code{x MOD y} and @code{x % y} return @code{x} modulus @code{y}, i.e.,
the nonnegative remainder of the division of @code{x} by @code{y}.

@item Signed Modulus
@code{x SMOD y} return the signed remainder of the division of
@code{x} by @code{y}, i.e., the smallest (in absolute terms)
remainder.  If @code{x = 3*y - 1} then @code{x MOD y} yields @code{y -

@subsection Binary Logical Conditional Operators

@cindex Binary logical conditional operators

@cindex Conditional operators, binary logical
@cindex Logical AND, conditional

Binary conditional operators are defined for integer scalars
(@ref{Scalars}).  They are somewhat similar to the corresponding binary
logical operators (@ref{Binary Logic}) but suppress evaluation of the
second operand if the first operand is sufficient to determine the value
of the whole expression.

The available conditional operators are:
@table @asis
@item Conditional And
@code{x ANDIF y} yields 0 if @code{x} is equal to zero (and then
@code{y} is not evaluated), and yields 1 if both @code{x} and @code{y}
are unequal to zero.  These results are the same as returned by @code{x
NE 0 AND y NE 0} (@ref{Binary Relationals}), except that @code{y} is not
evaluated if @code{x} is equal to zero, for then the value of the whole
expression is zero regardless of the value of @code{y}.

@item Conditional Or
@code{x ORIF y} yields 1 if @code{x} is unequal to zero (and then
@code{y} is not evaluated), and yields 0 if both @code{x} and @code{y}
are equal to zero.  These results are the same as returned by @code{x NE
0 OR y NE 0}, except that @code{y} is not evaluated if @code{x} is
unequal to zero, for then the value of the whole expression is zero
regardless of the value of @code{y}.
@end table

Conditional operators provide short-hand notation for certain IF
statements:
@example
IF x THEN
  IF y THEN statement
@end example
can be rewritten
@example
IF x ANDIF y THEN statement
@end example
and 
@example
IF @code{@var{x}} THEN
  statement
ELSE IF @code{@var{y}} THEN
  statement
@end example
can be rewritten
@example
IF @code{@var{x}} ORIF @code{@var{y}} THEN statement
@end example

Such @code{IF} statements (and therefore the use of conditional
operators) is useful if @code{y} is expensive to calculate or if it may
lead to an error when @code{y} is nonzero.  For example, in the @code{IF}
statement
@example
IF z EQ 0 ORIF 123/z GT 5 THEN T,'OK'
@end example
the @code{ORIF} operator prevents division by zero in @code{123/z} if
@code{z} is equal to zero, and in the @code{IF} statement
@example
IF ok EQ 17 ANDIF EXPENSIVE(x + 2) THEN T,'OK'
@end example
the @code{ANDIF} operator prevents evaluation of @code{EXPENSIVE(x + 2)}
if @code{ok} is not equal to 17.

Binary relational operators are defined for (real or complex) scalars
(@ref{Scalars}) and numerical arrays (@ref{Arrays}) and for strings
(@ref{Strings}).  They compare the values of the operands, and return
either a 1 or a 0, depending on whether the operands do or do not posess
the relation implied by the operator.  For string operands, relations
are tested based on the byte codes used internally by your computer to
represent the characters.  Most computers nowadays use ASCII code for
that, but some IBM mainframes use a different format.  In both of these
formats, letters are compared based on alphabetical order.  If the
second string is equal to the first one with some more characters
appended, then the second string is considered to lie closer to the end
of the alphabet than the first string.  When testing for relative order
involving one or more complex numbers, the numbers are compared by
magnitude.

The following relational operators are available:

@table @asis

@item Equal To
@code{x EQ y} returns 1 if @code{x} is equal to @code{y}.

@item Unequal To
@code{x NE y} returns 1 if @code{x} is unequal to @code{y}.

@item Greater Than
@code{x GT y} returns 1 if @code{x} is greater than @code{y}.

@item Greater Than Or Equal To
@code{x GE y} returns 1 if @code{x} is greater than or equal to @code{y}. 

@item Less Than
@code{x LT y} returns 1 if @code{x} is less than @code{y}.

@item Less Than Or Equal To
@code{x LE y} returns 1 if @code{x} is less than or equal to @code{y}. 
@end table

@item Lower Bound
@code{x < y} returns the smaller (i.e. closer to @minus{}Infinity) of
@code{x} and @code{y}.  If any of the operands is complex, then the

@code{x > y} returns the larger (i.e. closer to +Infinity) of @code{x}

A subscript is a device that selects certain elements from a set such as
an array (@ref{Arrays}), file array (@ref{File Arrays}), string
(@ref{Strings}) or associated variable (@ref{Associated Variables}).
You refer to one or more particular elements of a set by coordinates,
coordinate arrays, ranges, indices, or lists.  Coordinate array
subscripts, scalar subscripts, and range subscripts can be mixed freely.
Not just variables of the appropriate kinds, but also expressions of
those kinds can be subscripted.

If only a single subscript is specified (i.e., for a single dimension)
and the @code{/ALL} keyword is not specified, then the source is treated
as if it had only one dimension (containing all of its elements).

The result of the subscription has the same number of dimensions as the
subscripted variable, except that those dimensions of the result that
are equal to 1 are omitted, unless keyword @code{/KEEPDIMS} is used.

@subsubsection Coordinate Subscripts

@cindex Coordinate subscripts
@cindex Subscripts, coordinate

Reference to particular elements of an array by coordinates is done by
appending to the array the coordinates of the desired element, separated
by commas and enclosed in parentheses.  The coordinates of the first
element of an array are all equal to zero.  For instance, you select the
first element of a one-dimensional array named @code{y} by @code{y(0)},
the second element by @code{y(1)}, etcetera.  The elements of a 3-by-2
array named @code{u} are referred to as @code{u(0,0)}, @code{u(1,0)},
@code{u(2,0)}, @code{u(0,1)}, @code{u(1,1)}, and @code{u(2,1)}.

The same holds also for file arrays (@ref{File Arrays}).  Associated
variables (@ref{Associated Variables}) and strings (@ref{Strings})
allow only one coordinate.

If the @code{/SEPARATE} keyword is used, then the elements of a single
subscript of a numerical @code{ARRAY} type are interpreted as if each
was specified as a separate scalar.  In that case, only the single array
is allowed as a subscript, and it must have exactly one element for each
dimension of the source data, unless @code{/ZERO} or @code{/ALL} are
specified (@ref{Multiple Subscripts} for those keyword).  For example,
if @code{x} is a three-dimensional numerical array, then
@code{x([2,4,5], /SEPARATE)} is equivalent to @code{x(2,4,5)}.

@subsubsection Index Subscripts

@cindex Index subscripts
@cindex Subscripts, index

Reference to one or more particular elements of an array by index
entails appending the single index (or single array of indices) of the
desired element(s) to the array, between parentheses.  The elements of a
multi-dimensional array are stored with higher dimensions changing
slower than lower dimensions.  For example, the elements of a
3-by-2-element array @code{u} are stored in the order @code{u(0,0)},
@code{u(1,0)}, @code{u(2,0)}, @code{u(0,1)}, @code{u(1,1)},
@code{u(2,1)}, and the fourth element can be referred to both as
@code{u(0,1)} and as @code{u(3)}.  The notation @code{u([2,3,5])}
extracts the 3rd, 4th, and 5th elements of array @code{u} (because the
first element has index 0).

Index subscripts can also be applied to file arrays (@ref{File Arrays})
and to strings (@ref{Strings}).

@subsubsection Range Subscripts

@cindex Range subscripts
@cindex Subscripts, range

One can refer to a number of adjacent elements of an array
(@ref{Arrays}) by specifying in the concerned dimension(s) a range of
coordinates rather than a single one (as in @ref{Coordinate
Subscripts}).  Such a range subscript consists of a range variable or a
range expression (@ref{Ranges}) with some modifications.  Firstly,
parentheses around the range expression are not needed when they are
used as a subscript.  Secondly, two more optional fields are added to a
range expression in a subscript.

The most general range subscript looks like this:
@example
 r1:r2:+:>d
@end example
@code{r1} and @code{r2} are the range's start and end coordinates, and may
be replaced by a single range variable.  The plus sign in the optional
third field indicates that all elements in the range must be added up,
and only the result is returned.  The optional fourth field indicates
that the extracted range must be moved to dimension number @code{d}
(starting at zero) in the result.

Regard the following examples, with @code{x} a 3-by-4 array:
@example
 x(2:3,2)
 x(*,2:*)
 x(+,2)
 x(>1,>0)
@end example

The first example extracts the elements with coordinates @code{(2,2)}
and @code{(3,2)}, i.e. a 2-element one-dimensional array.  The second
example extracts all elements with their second coordinate equal to 2 or
3, i.e. a 3-by-2 array.  The third example adds all elements with their
second coordinate equal to 2 and returns the result, which is a scalar.
The last example moves dimension number 1 to dimension number 0 and vice
versa: It transposes the array.

You cannot specify both the summation (3rd) and redirection (4th)
fields, since the summation flagged by the plus sign in the third field
removes the corresponding dimension, which can then no longer be
redirected.  If you want to sum or redirect all elements in a particular
dimension, then you don't need to specify the first two fields.

Range subscripts can be applied to arrays, file arrays (@ref{File
Arrays}), and strings (@ref{Strings}), except that file arrays don't
support the summation field, and strings only support the range start
and end fields.

@cindex Arguments, variable numbers of

The elements of lists (@ref{Lists}) and structures (@ref{Structures}) in
argument lists can be interpreted by LUX as individual arguments rather
than as members of a single argument.  This is a mechanism for
specifying arbitrary numbers of arguments, and for assembling argument
lists on the fly.  For LUX to interpret lists and structures as such,
they must themselves contain a single list or structure.  This way we
can distinguish between the case where the user wants to specify a list
or structure as a single argument, and the case where the user wants to
specify a list or structure as a set of arguments, without causing too
much trouble.

For example, @code{FOO( x, y, @{ @{ a, b @} @}, z)} is interpreted as
@code{FOO( x, y, a, b, z)}, but in @code{FOO( x, y, @{ a, b @}, z)}, the
list is a single argument.  If @code{q} is equal to @code{@{ a, b @}},
then @code{FOO( x, y, @{ q @}, z)} is interpreted as the first example
above, and @code{FOO( x, y, q, z)} like the second one.

Lists and structures contained within a list or structure that is
interpreted as a set of arguments are also expanded into arguments: the
expansion is performed one level at a time.

This method can be used to support functions with variable number of
arguments.  For example, suppose you want to write a function that
constructs a file name by combining an arbitrary file name format with
the corresponding number of arguments.  You want your function to be
able to deal with any file name format and any corresponding number of
arguments.  Using lists of arguments, this can be done as follows:

@example
 FUNC FILENAME(format,args)
   RETURN,FSTRING(format, @{ @{args@} @})
 ENDFUNC
@end example

The enclosure of @code{args} in double curly braces in the function
definition ensures that this argument is expanded into a list of
arguments.  The call @code{filename('file%03d',7)} now returns
@code{'file007'}, and @code{filename('file-%s-%03d',@{'second',7@})}
yields @code{'file-second-007'}.  The two arguments @code{'second'} and
@code{7} must be enclosed in curly braces.

@subsubsection Multiple Subscripts

@cindex Multiple subscripts
@cindex Subscripts, multiple
@cindex Combining subscripts
@cindex Inner-style subscript combination
@cindex Outer-style subscript combination

You can use any of the different types of coordinate specifications
(scalar, range, array) for any of the coordinates.  If more than one
multiple-element coordinate is present, then the multiple-element
coordinates can be combined in two different ways: as a generalized
inner product (inner-style, selected by keyword @code{/INNER}) or a
generalized outer product (outer-style, selected by keyword
@code{/OUTER}).

If neither of these keywords is specified, then @code{/OUTER} is assumed
if none of the subscripts has more than one dimension, and @code{/INNER}
otherwise.

In the outer style, all combinations of array elements (one from each
multiple-element coordinate) are serviced and the dimensional structure
of the coordinate arrays is copied to the result.  For instance, if
@code{x} is an array of four by four elements, then
@code{x([1,2,3],[0,3])} is an array of three by two elements, and the
elements are (in increasing order of their index) @code{x(1,0)},
@code{x(2,0)}, @code{x(3,0)}, @code{x(1,3)}, @code{x(2,3)},
@code{x(3,3)}.  In this particular example, the same result would have
been obtained through @code{x(1:3,[0,3])}.

Redirection and summation as in range subscripts (@ref{Range
Subscripts}) may be applied to outer-style array subscripts.
Redirection specifies how to rearrange the sets of dimensions of the
subscripts, not the dimensions of the result.  With redirection you can
change where the dimensions of a particular subscript end up relative to
the dimensions of the other subscripts, but the order of dimensions of
each subscript is preserved.  For example, if @code{c1} is a 2-by-3
array and @code{c2} a 4-element array, then @code{z(c1, c2)} is an array
with dimensions 2 by 3 by 4 (the 2 by 3 coming from @code{c1} and the 4
from @code{c2}), and @code{z(c1:>1, c2:>0)} an array with dimensions 4
by 2 by 3 (i.e., the dimensions of @code{c1} have been moved relative to
those of @code{c2}, but the dimensions of @code{c1} are in the same
relative order).

In the inner style (keyword @code{/INNER}), all multiple-element
coordinates must have the same number of elements and the next element
of all multiple-element coordinates is taken for each next output
element.  For example, with the previously defined @code{x},
@code{x([1,2],[3,4],/INNER)} is an array of two elements, equal to
@code{[x(1,3), x(2,4)]}.  The dimensional structure of the result is
equal to the dimensional structure of the first non-scalar subscript (a
range is considered equivalent to a one-dimensional array in this case).

Redirection and summation are not implemented for inner-style array
subscripts, because the dimensional structure of the result is not
related to the number of subscripts.

Combination subscripts can also be applied to file arrays (@ref{File
Arrays}) and to strings (@ref{Strings}).

It is an error to specify fewer coordinate arguments than there are
dimensions in the subscripted variable, except if you specify one
coordinate argument (@ref{Index Subscripts}) or if you specify one of
the keywords @code{/ZERO} and @code{/ALL}.  If you specify @code{/ZERO},
then all unspecified coordinates are assumed equal to zero.  For
instance, if @code{x} is an array with 3 by 2 by 5 by 3 elements, then
@code{x(2,1,/ZERO)} is equivalent to @code{x(2,1,0,0)}.  If you specify
@code{/ALL}, then all unspecified coordinates are assumed equal to
@code{*}.  For example, with the same @code{x} as before,
@code{x(2,1,/ALL)} is equivalent to @code{x(2,1,*,*)}.

The @code{/SUBGRID} keyword in

forces linear interpolation in @code{x} at the specified coordinates.
Without this keyword, floating-point subscripts are converted to integer
type and the elements corresponding to those integer subscripts are then
extracted from the source variable.

This keyword can only be used with numerical arrays @code{x}, and only
numerical arrays and scalars are allowed as subscripts.  The result is
@code{DOUBE} if @code{@var{x}} is @code{DOUBLE}, and @code{FLOAT}
otherwise.  If @code{/SUBGRID} is specified, then @code{/INNER} is
implied.  For example, @code{x([1.2,2.3], [3.3,4.1], /SUBGRID)} is
equivalent to @code{[x(1.2, 3.3, /SUBGRID), x(2.3, 4.1, /SUBGRID)]}.

@section Function Call

@cindex Function call
@cindex Function evaluation
@cindex Calling a function
@cindex Evaluating a function

A function is a piece of code that returns a value, depending on the
values the user specifies for the parameters of the function, if any.
LUX offers many built-in functions (@ref{Internal Routines}), and also
allows you to define and call your own functions, written in the LUX
language (@ref{Function Definition}).

A general function call consists of the name of the function, followed
by a pair of parentheses enclosing the arguments (if any), which are
separated by commas.  Some functions can be called without any
arguments, but the parentheses must be specified also in this case.

See @ref{Arguments} to learn about the various ways to specify arguments
to a function.

If the function name in a function call is not one of the names of a
built-in function or of an already defined user-defined function, then
LUX tries to find a file that contains a definition for the as yet
undefined function.  LUX looks for a file with the same name as the
function, in lower-case letters, and with the @file{_f.lux} suffix
added.  LUX looks for this file in the current directory, in the
directory, if any, that was specified using @code{ULIB} (@ref{ULIB}),
and in the directories which are listed, separated by colons (@kbd{:}),
in the environment variable @code{LUX_PATH} (see @ref{Environment}).  If
such a file is found, then it is included at this point.  If the sought
function is still not defined after the file has been included, then an
error message is displayed.

A function is required to return a value (using the @code{RETURN}
command -- @ref{RETURN}).  If the end of a function is reached and no
value has been @code{RETURN}ed, then an error is generated.

Some functions can be called with more arguments than it has parameters.
See @ref{Extended Parameter Lists} for details.

The @emph{parameters} to a function or a subroutine are the variables,
local to the routine, that the user can specify values for and that are
referred to inside the function or subroutine.  The @emph{arguments} are
the values that the user specifies for these parameters.

The arguments of a routine can be specified in various ways.  In
addition, you may leave some or all arguments to a subroutine or
function unspecified.

@cindex Parameters, specifying values for
@cindex Functions, argument specification
@cindex Routines, argument specification
@cindex Subroutines, argument specification
@cindex Specification of arguments
@cindex Keyword arguments
@cindex Keyword assignment

The parameters of a subroutine or function have a definite order.  The
arguments of the routine can be specified in three ways:

@table @asis
@item By Position
Any expression can be used as an argument to a routine.  Each argument
is linked to a parameter of the routine in the order of specification.
I.e., the first argument is assigned to the first parameter, the second
argument to the second parameter, and so on.

@item By Keyword Assignment
Some (if any) of the parameters of a built-in routine have a keyword
associated with them.  You can specify a value for such a parameter by
assigning that value to the keyword associated with the parameter.  For
instance, if the third parameter of routine @code{MYFUNC()} has keyword
@code{DATA} associated with it, then @code{MYFUNC(DATA=5)} assigns the
value 5 to that third parameter.

All parameters of user-defined subroutines and functions automatically
act as keywords, too.  For example, if @code{USERFUNC()} is a
user-defined function with parameters @code{x} and @code{y}, then
@code{USERFUNC(y=3)} assigns the value @code{3} to parameter @code{y}.

@item By Keyword Switch
Some built-in routines have special keyword switches to which no value
can be assigned, but which either select or deselect a particular
feature of the routine.  Specify such a keyword switch by prepending the
name of the switch by @code{/} if you want to select the corresponding
feature, or by @code{/NO} if you want to deselect the corresponding
feature.  For instance, @code{DIFFER(x,3)} returns the third-order
forward difference of array @code{x}, and keyword switch @code{/CENTRAL}
in @code{DIFFER(x,3,/CENTRAL)} modifies the forward difference to
a central difference.

The same notation can also be used for keywords that do accept values
(including all parameters of user-defined functions and subroutines).
For such a keyword, @code{/KEYWORD} is equivalent to @code{KEYWORD=1},
and @code{/NOKEYWORD} is equivalent to @code{KEYWORD=0}.
@end table

These three different ways of specifying parameters can be mixed.
Keyword switches and keyword assignments can be specified in any order
and anywhere between the other types of arguments.  Keyword switches are
ignored during the assignment of the other arguments to the routine's
parameters.  The position of the other types of arguments has no
influence on the assignment of arguments-by-position to parameters.  For
instance, the following function calls are all equivalent (assuming that
keyword @code{DATA} is associated with the third parameter):

@example
MYFUNC(x, y, z, /FAST)
MYFUNC(DATA = z, x, /FAST, y)
MYFUNC(/FAST, x, y, z)
@end example

It is illegal to specify more than one value for a single parameter.
For instance, the function call @code{MYFUNC(x, y, z,
/FAST, DATA = 5)} (with @code{MYFUNC} as described above) is illegal,
because two arguments are specified for the third parameter, namely
@code{z} and @code{5}.

@subsubsection Empty Arguments

@cindex Empty arguments
@cindex Arguments, empty
@cindex Parameters, empty

You may specify no value for some or all of the arguments to a function
or subroutine.  What happens in that case depends on the routine or
function.  Some of the arguments to the routine may be required.  If you
do not specify a value for such an argument, then an error is generated.

For some of the arguments to a routine a default value may be specified
inside the routine.  In that case, if the user specifies no value for
that argument, then the default value is used instead as if the user
specified that value.

Default values can be assigned to arbitrary variables (including
parameters of user-defined subroutines and functions) using either the
@code{DEFAULT} subroutine (@ref{DEFAULT}) or the @code{DEFINED} function
(@ref{DEFINED}).  For instance,
@example
  DEFAULT,x,2
  IF NOT(DEFINED(x)) THEN x = 2
@end example
both assign the value 2 to variable @code{x} if it was undefined before.
If @code{x} is a pointer (@ref{Pointers}) or a parameter to a
user-defined subroutine or function, then it is considered to be
undefined if it is ultimately linked to a value that is undefined.
Global variables (@ref{Global Variables}) are treated in the same way.

Inside a user-defined subroutine or function the parameters of the
routine must be distinguished from the other variables, because we must
be able to tell the difference between the case where the user did not
specify a value for the parameter and the case where the user did
specify a value but the value happens to be undefined.  The use of the
@code{DEFINED} function as above would return 0 in both of these cases.

@code{DEFINED(x, /TARGET)} returns 1 if @code{x} is a pointer, and
if @code{x} is a parameter to a user-defined function or subroutine for
which the user has specified a value (even if that value happens to be
undefined).

Consider the following example:
@need 800
@example
  SUBR FOO,x
    T,DEFINED(x),DEFINED(x,/ARGUMENT)
    FIE,x
  ENDSUBR

  SUBR FIE,a
    T,DEFINED(a),DEFINED(a,/ARGUMENT)
  ENDSUBR
@end example

If one executes @code{FOO,5} then one gets @code{1, 1, 1, 1} as result,
because the parameters @code{x} of @code{FOO} and @code{a} of @code{FIE}
have the value @code{5}.  If one executes @code{FOO,z} where @code{z} is
undefined, then one gets @code{0, 1, 0, 1}, because a value was defined
for the parameters, but that value is undefined.  If one executes
@code{FOO} without any argument, then one gets @code{0, 0, 0, 0},
because the user did not specify a value for any of the parameters.

Note that zeros are returned by @code{FIE} in this case even though an
argument to @code{FIE} was specified in @code{FOO}: the argument to
@code{FIE} in @code{FOO} itself did not have a user-specified value, and
this property is inherited by the parameter of @code{FIE}.

@subsection Recursion

@cindex Recursion
@cindex Functions calling themselves
@cindex Routines calling themselves
@cindex Subroutines calling themselves

Recursion is the act of calling a routine (subroutine or function) as
part of its own execution.  Recursion is allowed for all routines in
LUX, whether they are built-in or user-defined.

The parameters of a user-defined routine are independent from instance
to instance: If more than one instance of a particular user-defined
routine is active at the same time, then a particular parameter in one
copy of the routine is independent of the version of the same parameter
in all other copies of the routine.  However, the values of the
parameters are lost when the routine is finished.

The strictly local variables of the routine are not covered by this
rule: only a single copy of such variables exists, which is shared
between all instances of the routine, and which retains its value even
after the routine is finished.

It is quite easy to define a function or subroutine that keeps calling
itself indefinitely.  LUX leaves checking for such infinite recursion up
to the user.

For example, here is a definition for a function that calculates the
factorial of a positive integer number @code{n} (i.e., the product of all
numbers between 1 and @code{n}, inclusive):

@example
func fac(n)
  if n eq 1 then return,n
  return,n*fac(n-1)
endfunc
@end example

If we call this function with argument @code{3}, then @code{foo(3)}
calls @code{foo(2)}, which calls @code{foo(1)}.  When @code{foo(1)} is
being evaluated, three instances of @code{foo()} are active at the same
time, each with their own independent copy of @code{n}.

In this particular example, the function is not waterproof against
infinite recursion.  If you call the function with a number smaller than
1, or with a number that is not an integer, then it will keep calling
itself indefinitely until all those different instances of @code{foo()}
fill up LUX's symbol tables.

@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Order of Precedence

When you enter an expression that contains more than one operator, then
it may not be clear which operation should be performed first.  For
example, in the expression @code{6 + 3 * 4} one might choose to perform
the addition first and the multiplication later, yielding @code{(6 + 3) *
4 = 9 * 4 = 36}, or one might choose to perform the multiplication
first and the addition later, yielding @code{6 + (3 * 4) = 6 + 12 = 18}.
To take care of situations like this, the operators are assigned an
@emph{order of precedence}: an indication of which operator goes first
in any situation.

The following list shows groups containing operators of equal
precedence, with the groups listed in order of decreasing precedence:

@enumerate
@item
@code{.} @code{()}
@item
@code{^}
@item
Unary minus
@item
@code{*} @code{/} @code{%} @code{MOD} @code{SMOD} @code{#}
@item
@code{+} @code{-}
@item
@code{<} @code{>}
@item
@code{GE} @code{LE} @code{GT} @code{LT} @code{EQ} @code{NE}
@item
@code{AND} @code{OR} @code{XOR} @code{&} @code{|}
@item
@code{ANDIF} @code{ORIF}
@end enumerate

For example, multiplication (@code{*}) has a higher precedence than
addition (@code{+}), so in our example @code{6 + 3 * 4}, multiplication
goes first and addition second.  You can make the addition go first
after all by making the order explicit using grouping with parentheses
(which has the highest precedence): @code{(6 + 3) * 4} yields @code{36}.

All operators except power-taking (@code{^}) have @emph{left
associativity}: if they are combined with operators of equal precedence,
then the operations are evaluated from left to right.  For example, in
@code{3 * 4 / 5}, the multiplication and the division have the same
order of precedence and are both left associative, so the leftmost
operation, in this case the multiplication, goes first, yielding
@code{2} (remember that the example involves integers only).  With
enforced precedence for the division, through @code{3 * (4 / 5)}, we get
@code{0}.

The operators with the greatest precedence are grouping with
parentheses, and selecting a member from a list or structure (@code{.}).
@emph{Unary minus} refers to a minus sign applied to a single argument,
and it has high precedence.  For example, @code{- 3 + 4} yields
@code{1}, and not @code{-7}.  However, the precedence of power-taking is
higher than that of unary minus, so @code{-3^2} is equal to @code{-9}.
Power-taking has @emph{right associativity}, so @code{3 ^ 4 ^ 2} is
interpreted as @code{3 ^ (4 ^ 2) = 3 ^ 16}.

Using parentheses, one can explicitly indicate any desired precedence.

@cindex Statements

A computer program in the LUX language is a set of @emph{statements},
which are executed in the order in which they are encountered.
Statements execute commands and control the flow of execution.
Statements usually involve expressions and may contain other statements.

LUX offers many statements.  The assignment and insertion statements
allow storage of data in variables.  The @code{IF}, @code{CASE}, and
@code{NCASE} statements allow @emph{branching}, i.e., execution of
statements depending on one or more conditions.  The @code{FOR},
@code{REPEAT}, @code{WHILE-DO}, and @code{DO-WHILE} statements allow
@emph{loops}, i.e., repetition of statements.  A block statement allows
a set of statements to be treated as a single one.  The block routine
(@code{BLOCK}), subroutine (@code{SUBR}), and function (@code{FUNC})
definition statements allow definition of routines written in the LUX
language.  Block routine and subroutine calls allow these user-defined
routines to be used.  The jump statements @code{BREAK}, @code{CONTINUE},
@code{RETALL}, and @code{RETURN} allow (restricted) forced exit from
loops and routines.  File inclusion statements (@code{@@} and
@code{@@@@}) allow the contents of a file to be read and executed.

In the formal description of the syntax of these statements, square
brackets @code{[]} enclose optional parts, and dots @dots{} indicate
that the preceding phrase may be repeated.

@subsection Straight Assignment

@cindex Simple assignment

In a straight assignment the whole data contents of a variable are
replaced, as follows:
@need 800
@example
@code{@var{var}} = @code{@var{expr}}
@end example

The variable receives as its value a copy of the value of the
expression, and assumes the data class and type of the expression.  The
expression is not changed in any way by this assignment.

@subsection Insertion

@cindex Inserting values

Insertions, assignments to parts of a variable, are done using the same
notation on the left-hand side of the equal sign as is used on the
right-hand side to extract those very same parts (@ref{Subscripts}),
except that currently no more than one subscript list (between
parentheses) or structure tag expression (after a period) can be
specified on the left-hand side of an assignment, and summation and
redirection flags are not allowed in range subscripts (@ref{Range
Subscripts}). 

Some examples are:

@example
x(*,i,7,/INNER) = y(3,2,*)
s.name = 'Jones'
s.3 = z
@end example

@subsubsection Insertion through Subscripts

@cindex Inserting using subscripts
@cindex Subscripts, inserting using

Insertion into arrays (@ref{Arrays}), strings (@ref{Strings}), file
arrays (@ref{File Arrays}), and associated variables (@ref{Associated
Variables}) goes according to the following format:

@code{@var{var}(@code{@var{subscripts}}) = @code{@var{expr}}}

where @code{@var{subscripts}} is a comma-separated list of one or more
subscripts (only one subscript is allowed for associated variables).
The subscripts (after expansion of lists and structures, @ref{Lists of
Subscripts}) may be scalars (@ref{Scalars}), ranges (@ref{Ranges}), or
numerical arrays (@ref{Arrays}), and in general there must be as many
subscripts as there are dimensions in @code{@var{var}}.

If @code{@var{expr}} has only one element, then this element is inserted
at every place indicated by the @code{@var{subscripts}}.  In that case
the conditions on the dimensions of @code{@var{expr}} that are listed
below do not apply.

You specify the part of @code{@var{var}} that receives values from
@code{@var{expr}} in one of the following ways:

@enumerate 1
@item
By specifying the coordinates of all elements in that part, using
ranges, scalars, or numerical arrays.  The different subscripts can be
combined in two different ways, which are indicated by keywords.

Keyword @code{/OUTER} specifies that the coordinates are combined as in
a generalized outer product: all possible combinations of the various
coordinates are serviced.  For example, in @code{x(1:2,[7,4,2]) =
@var{expr}}, @code{@var{expr}} must have dimensions 2 by 3, and the
elements of @code{@var{expr}} (in the order @code{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1),
(1,1), (0,2), (1,2)}) are inserted into @code{x} in the elements
@code{(1,7), (2,7), (1,4), (2,4), (1,2), (2,2)} respectively.

In this case each dimension of @code{@var{expr}} must be equal to the
number of elements in the corresponding non-scalar subscript to
@code{x}.

Keyword @code{/INNER} specifies that the coordinates are combined as in
a generalized inner product: each element of each multi-element
subscript is used only once.  For example, in
@code{x([1,2],[7,4],/INNER) = @var{expr}}, the @code{@var{expr}} must
have the same number of elements as each multi-element subscript to
@code{x}, and all multi-element subscripts to @code{x} must have the
same number of elements.  The elements of @code{@var{expr}} are inserted
in @code{x} in the elements @code{(1,7), (2,4)}, respectively.

By default, @code{/OUTER} is assumed if none of the subscripts has more
than one dimension, and @code{/INNER} otherwise.

In addition, the elements of a single subscript which is a numerical
@code{ARRAY} can be interpreted as if its elements were specified as
separate @code{SCALAR}s, by specifying the @code{/SEPARATE} keyword.

You may specify fewer subscripts than there are dimensions only if you
also specify one of the keywords @code{/ZERO} or @code{/ALL}.  Keyword
@code{/ZERO} indicates that all omitted remaining subscripts are to be
taken equal to zero.  Keyword @code{/ALL} indicates that all omitted
remaining subscripts are to be taken equal to @code{*}.  These keywords
can be combined with keyword @code{/SEPARATE}.

@item

By specifying the coordinates of the lowest corner of that part (if the
part is a single block in all of its dimensions).  If @code{@var{expr}}
has fewer dimensions than @code{@var{var}}, or if keyword @code{/ONEDIM}
is specified, then the insertion is done in one-dimensional fashion,
starting at the element of @code{@var{var}} that is indicated by the
subscripts.  For example, in @code{x(2,4,0) = @code{@var{expr}}} with
@code{@var{expr}} having fewer than three dimensions, the elements of
@code{@var{expr}} are inserted into consecutive elements of @code{x},
starting at the element of @code{x} that corresponds to coordinates
@code{(2,4,0)}.

If @code{@var{expr}} has the same number of dimensions as
@code{@var{var}} and if keyword @code{/ONEDIM} is not specified, then
the insertion is done taking the dimensional structure of
@code{@var{var}} into account.  For example, regard @code{x(2,4,0) =
@code{@var{expr}}} with @code{@var{expr}} with 3 dimensions.  Assuming
that @code{@var{expr}} has at least two elements in each dimension,
elements @code{(0,0,0), (1,0,0)} of @code{@var{expr}} are inserted in
elements @code{(2,4,0), (3,4,0)} of @code{x}.  Elements @code{(0,1,0),
(1,1,0)} go to @code{(2,5,0), (3,5,0)}, and elements @code{(0,0,1),
(1,0,1)} to @code{(2,4,1), (3,4,1)}.

@item
By specifying one index to @code{@var{var}}.  In this case
@code{@var{var}} and @code{@var{expr}} are treated as one-dimensional
arrays and the elements of @code{@var{expr}} are inserted in
@code{@var{var}} starting at the specified index.

@end enumerate

In any of the methods of insertion, it is illegal to try to insert data
beyond the boundaries of the target.

The intention is to expand this kind of insertion to allow multiple
levels of insertion target specifications (such as
@code{x(5,*)(22).ALPHA = y}), but this is not yet implemented.

@subsubsection Insertion into Structures and Similar Data Classes

@cindex Inserting into Structures
@cindex Inserting into Lists
@cindex Inserting into Ranges

You can insert into structures (@ref{Structures}), lists (@ref{Lists}),
and ranges (@ref{Ranges}) using subscripts, for example

@code{@var{var}(@var{number}) = @code{@var{expr}}}

where @code{@var{number}} is a single integer number which indicates the
index of the element in the list that is to be modified.  The first
element has index zero.  The index must lie within the valid range.

Insertion into structures can also go according to

@code{@var{var}.@var{keyword} = @code{@var{expr}}}

where @code{@var{keyword}} must be one of the keywords specified in the
structure.

The intention is to expand this kind of insertion to allow multiple
levels of insertion target specifications (such as @code{x.3(5).ALPHA =
y}), but this is not yet implemented.

@cindex IF statement

The @code{IF} statement selects one of two statements for execution,
depending on a condition.

@example
IF @var{expr} THEN @var{statement1} [ ELSE @var{statement2} ]
@end example

The condition expression @code{@var{expr}} is evaluated.  Its value must
be a scalar.  If the value is non-zero, then statement
@code{@var{statement1}} is executed.  If the condition evaluates to
zero, and the optional @code{ELSE} part was specified, then
@code{@var{statement2}} is executed.  If the condition evaluates to zero
but no @code{ELSE} part was specified, then this statement does nothing
and execution passes on directly to the next statement.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------
@node CASE Statement, NCASE Statement, IF Statement, Statements
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section CASE Statement

@cindex CASE statement
@cindex Statement selection by condition

The @code{CASE} statement selects one of a set of statements for
execution, depending on a set of conditions.

@example
CASE
  @var{expr1} : @var{statement1}
[ @var{expr2} : @var{statement2}
  @dots{} ]
[ ELSE @var{statement} ]
ENDCASE
@end example

The condition expressions @code{@var{expr1}}, @code{@var{expr2}}, and so
on are evaluated in turn until the first non-zero value (i.e., true
condition) is found.  Then, the corresponding statement
@code{@var{statement1}} or @code{@var{statement2}}, etcetera, is
executed.  If none of the conditions evaluates to a non-zero value, then
the @code{ELSE} statement @code{@var{statement}} is executed, if an
@code{ELSE} part was specified.  Otherwise, this @code{CASE} statement
does nothing and control passes directly to the next statement.

All evaluated conditions must have scalar values.

@node NCASE Statement, FOR Statement, CASE Statement, Statements

@section NCASE Statement

@cindex NCASE statement

The @code{NCASE} statement selects one of a set of statements for
execution, depending on a single control value.

@example
NCASE @var{expr}
  @var{statement1}
[ @var{statement2}
  @dots{} ]
[ ELSE @var{statement} ]
ENDCASE
@end example

The control expression @code{@var{expr}} is evaluated.  It must have a
scalar value, and the integer part of this value is then used as control
value.  If the control value is zero, one, etcetera, then the first,
second, etcetera, statement @code{@var{statement1}},
@code{@var{statement2}}, etcetera, is executed.  If there is no
statement corresponding to the control value, then the @code{ELSE}
statement @code{@var{statement}} is executed, if an @code{ELSE} part was
specified.  Otherwise, this @code{NCASE} statement does nothing and
control passes directly to the next one.

The @code{FOR} statement repeats a statement a specific number of times.

@example
FOR @var{var} = @var{expr1}, @var{expr2} [, @var{expr3}] [ DO ]
   @var{statement}
@end example

Variable @code{@var{var}} is the loop variable.  It is assigned the
value of @code{@var{expr1}}.  Then the statement @code{@var{statement}}
is executed.  Then the loop variable is incremented by
@code{@var{expr3}}, if specified, or by one otherwise.  If the value of
the loop variable is now greater than that of @code{@var{expr2}}, then
the loop is finished and control passes to the next statement.
Otherwise, the loop is repeated.

For example,
@example
LUX>FOR i = 1,5 T,i*i
      1
      4
      9

The @code{REPEAT} statement repeats a statement until a condition,
tested at the end of the loop, is met.

@example
REPEAT @var{statement} UNTIL @var{expr}
@end example

The statement @code{@var{statement}} is executed.  Then the condition
@code{@var{expr}} is evaluated.  If the condition is non-zero, then the loop
terminates.  Otherwise, the loop is repeated until the condition becomes
non-zero.  The statement @code{@var{statement}} is always executed at least
once, even if the condition @code{@var{expr}} is true to begin with.

@example
WHILE @var{expr} DO @code{statement}
@end example

The condition @code{@var{expr}} is evaluated.  If its value is zero
(i.e., the condition is false), then the @code{WHILE-DO} statement does
nothing and control flow passes on to the next statement.  If the
condition is non-zero (i.e., the condition is true), then the statement
@code{@var{statement}} is executed and the condition is re-evaluated,
iterating until the condition becomes true.

@example
DO @var{statement} WHILE @var{expr}
@end example

The statement @code{@var{statement}} is executed.  Then the condition
@code{@var{expr}} is evaluated.  If the condition is zero (false), then
the loop terminates.  Otherwise, the loop is repeated until the
condition does become false.  The statement is always executed at least

A block routine is a set of statements to which a name has been
assigned.

@example
BLOCK @var{name}
  @var{statement1}
[ @var{statement2}
  @dots{} ]
ENDBLOCK
@end example

The name of the block routine must start with a letter, and subsequent
characters of the name must be letters, digits, or the character
@kbd{_}.

Block routines can be defined at the main level of execution (i.e., at
the @samp{LUX>} prompt), or inside a user-defined function
(@ref{Function Definition}) or subroutine (@ref{Subroutine Definition}).
The variables used inside a block routine are local (@ref{Local
Variables}) to the main execution level or to the function or subroutine
in which the block routine is defined.  Block routines should only be
executed in the same context in which they were defined.  At present, a
block routine that is defined inside a function or subroutine still
appears in a @code{DUMP} (@ref{DUMP}) at the main level of excution, and
is not deleted when the function or subroutine in which it was defined
is.  This behavior needs to be streamlined.

See @ref{Block Routine Execution} for execution of such a block routine.

@cindex Routine definition
@cindex Definition of subroutine

A subroutine is a named "black box" that performs a specific task.  The
user interacts with the subroutine through the subroutine's parameters,
and possibly through global variables (@ref{Global Variables}).

LUX offers many built-in subroutines (@ref{Internal Routines}), and also
allows you to define your own in the LUX language, with a subroutine
definition statement.  All variables that are used inside such a
definition are local to the routine (@ref{Local Variables}), except for
those variables whose names start with one of the characters @kbd{! #
$}, which are global (@ref{Global Variables}).

@example
SUBR @var{name} [ , @var{par1}, @var{par2}, @dots{} ]
  @var{statement1}
[ @var{statement2}
  @dots{} ]
ENDSUBR
@end example

This defines a subroutine called @code{@var{name}}, with parameters
@code{@var{par1}}, @code{@var{par2}}, etcetera.  The subroutine consists
of the statements @code{@var{statement1}}, @code{@var{statement2}},
etcetera, which use the parameters to determine what needs to be done.

A special method is available for allowing arbitrary numbers of
variables.  It is selected by adding a triple period (@code{...}) as the
last parameter of the subroutine, and then if any arguments fall beyond
the last regular one, then the last regular parameter is changed into a
@code{CPLIST} variable and its previous value and all subsequent ones
are entered into the list in the order in which they are specified.  An
argument list that ends with @code{...} is referred to as an
@emph{extended parameter list}.

See also: @ref{Subroutine Call}, @ref{Extended Parameter Lists}

[2.13.178]

@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Subroutine Call

@cindex Subroutine call
@cindex Calling a subroutine
@cindex Executing a subroutine

A subroutine is a named "black box" that performs a specific task,
depending on the values that are specified for the subroutine's
parameters, if any, and possibly on the values of some global variables
(@ref{Global Variables}).

@example
name [, arg1, arg2 @dots{} ]
@end example
calls the subroutine that has name @code{name}, with the listed
arguments, separated by commas.  A subroutine call need not have any
arguments.  See @ref{Arguments} to learn more about the various ways in
which arguments can be specified for subroutines.

LUX offers many internal subroutines (@ref{Internal Routines}), and
also allows the user to define subroutines written in the LUX language
(@ref{Subroutine Definition}).

Because internal subroutines, user-defined subroutines, and subroutine
pointer variables (@ref{Pointers}) all have their own name spaces,
symbols of these three kinds can exist at the same time even if they all
have the same name.  For instance, in addition to the internal
subroutine called @code{LIMITS} (@ref{LIMITS}), one can also have a
subroutine pointer named @code{limits} and a user-defined subroutine
named @code{LIMITS}, all at the same time (remember that upper case and
lower case letters are equivalent in this situation).

Which of these three possibilities is to be executed is determined at
compile time, as described below.  The first match (at the time that the
statement is compiled) is taken.

@enumerate
@item
If the subroutine symbol is a pointer (@ref{Pointers}) to an internal
or (possibly not yet compiled) user-defined subroutine, then that
subroutine is taken.
@item
If a user-defined subroutine exists with the indicated name, then that
subroutine is taken.
@item
If an internal subroutine exists with the indicated name, then that
subroutine is taken.
@item
Otherwise, a user-defined subroutine with the indicated name is assumed
to become available, and that subroutine is taken.
@end enumerate

If during execution a user-defined subroutine turns out not to have been
compiled yet, then LUX tries to find a file that contains a definition
for that subroutine.  LUX looks for a file with the same name as the
subroutine, transformed to all lower-case letters, and with the
@file{.lux} suffix added.  LUX looks for this file in the directories
which are listed, separated by colons (@kbd{:}) in the environment
variable @code{LUX_PATH} (@ref{Environment}), and in the directory, if
any, that was specified using @code{ULIB} (@ref{ULIB}).  If such a file
is found, then it is included at this point.  If the sought subroutine
is still not defined after the file has been included, then an error
message is displayed.

The way of linking a subroutine symbol to a particular subroutine at
compile time allows various kinds of @emph{shadowing}, of hiding a
particular subroutine behind some other one.  E.g., you can hide the
internal definition for @code{LIMITS} by defining your own version
(@ref{Subroutine Definition}), or by creating a pointer with that same
name that points at a subroutine of your choice, and you can hide a
user-defined subroutine named @code{MYCODE} by defining a pointer with
that same name that points at another subroutine.  The hidden
definitions are not deleted; they are merely hidden and can be restored
as first choice by deleting the overlaid definitions.

Subroutines can be called recursively.  See @ref{Recursion} for details.

Some subroutines can be called with more arguments than it has
parameters.  See @ref{Extended Parameter Lists} for details.

@section Extended Parameter Lists

If a subroutine or function was defined by the user with an extended
parameter list (@ref{Subroutine Definition}, @ref{Function Definition})
and if it is called with more arguments than there are explicit
parameters in the parameter list, then the last named parameter is
changed into a @code{CPLIST} variable and the excess arguments are
stored in it.  A @code{CPLIST} variable is a compact list of pointers to
variables, and (currently) occurs only in the context of an extended
parameter list to a user-defined subroutine or function.

@example
 SUBR FOO,x,...
   (statements)
 ENDSUBR
@end example

The above example shows the simplest extended parameter list.  If this
subroutine is called through @code{FOO,y} then, inside the subroutine,
@code{x} will receive whatever the value of @code{y} happens to be.
This is just like what would happen if the subroutine were defined
without the @code{...}.

However, if the subroutine is called through @code{FOO, x, y}, then
there are more arguments than explicit parameters, and then the extended
parameter treatment will be used: inside the subroutine, @code{x} will
be a compact pointer list, equal to @code{@{&x, &y@}}.  In that case,
you can assign the value @code{5} to @code{y} inside the subroutine by
including a statement like @code{x(1) = 5}.

@section Function Definition

@cindex Function definition
@cindex Definition of a function

A function is a named "black box" that returns a value.  The user
interacts with the function through the function's parameters, and
possibly through global variables (@ref{Global Variables}).

LUX offers many built-in functions (@ref{Internal Routines}), and also
allows you to define your own in the LUX language, with a function
definition statement.

@example
FUNC @var{name} [ , @var{par1}, @var{par2}, @dots{} ]
  @var{statement1}
[ @var{statement2}
  @dots{} ]
ENDFUNC
@end example

This defines a function called @code{@var{name}}, with parameters
@code{@var{par1}}, @code{@var{par2}}, etcetera.  The function consists
of the statements @code{@var{statement1}}, @code{@var{statement2}},
etcetera, which use the parameters to determine what needs to be done.
A function must return a value, and to this end at least one
@code{RETURN} statement must appear in each function definition.  A
@code{RETURN} statement in a function definition looks like this:

@example
RETURN, @var{value}
@end example

The value @code{@var{value}} is what the function call returns.  See
@ref{Function Call} for the use of a function.

A special method is available for allowing arbitrary numbers of
variables.  It is selected by adding a triple period (@code{...}) as the
last parameter of the subroutine, and then if any arguments fall beyond
the last regular one, then the last regular parameter is changed into a
@code{CPLIST} variable and its previous value and all subsequent ones
are entered into the list in the order in which they are specified.

See @code{Extended Parameter Lists} for more details.

@section Jumps

@cindex Jump statements

Control flow in a piece of LUX code generally goes from one statement to
the next, with various loop and branch statements offering repetition
and choice, and with user-defined subroutines, functions, and
blockroutines offering modular structure.  Control flow is easy to
follow in such modular programs.

Some programming languages allow unconditional, unrestricted jumps to
arbitrarily distant statements.  Programs that use such jumps are
sometimes referred to as "spaghetti" programs, as it tends to be hard to
analyze such a program and to know what it will do.

LUX does not offer unrestricted jumps, since one can cast any algorithm
in a form without such jumps.  However, LUX does offer a small number of
restricted jump statements which can be useful to exit from loop
statements and other modular structures.

@section Command File Inclusion

@cindex File inclusion
@cindex Including a file as LUX input
@cindex Reading LUX input from a file
@cindex LUX input from a file
@cindex @@ statement
@cindex @@@@ statement

If you have a file with a number of LUX statements in it, then you can
execute those statements as if you typed them at the keyboard by
including the file as follows:
@example
@@@var{file}
@end example

If the filename @code{@var{file}} has no extension (i.e., no period in it),
then @file{.lux} is added to it.  If the file with the extension is not
found, then the file without the extension is tried.

A special form of file inclusion is selected by typing two at-signs
@kbd{@@} instead of one:
@example
@@@@@var{file}
@end example

This restricted file inclusion works just like ordinary file inclusion,
except that any subroutine, function, and blockroutine definitions that
are present in the file are not performed.  If the concerned routine was
already defined, then this previous definition is retained.  If the
concerned routine does not yet exist, then the name of the routine, the
file, and the position of the definition in the file are remembered.  If
the routine is called later on, then its definition is read from the
file and performed at that time.  This restricted file inclusion
prevents unnecessary repeated definition of a routine.  If you do want
to change the definition of an already defined routine, then use
ordinary file inclusion.

@section Ignoring Input

@cindex Comments
@cindex Ignoring input
@cindex IGNORE statement
@cindex RESUME statement

There are two ways in which you can have LUX ignore text.  If you wish
for LUX to ignore part of a line, then prepend a semicolon (;) to the
part you want to be ignored.  LUX considers a semicolon (outside of a
literal string -- @ref{Strings}) and everything that follows it through
the end of the line a comment.  Such comments are totally ignored: LUX
acts as if they are not there.

If you want LUX to ignore many subsequent lines, then use the
@code{IGNORE} statement as the first statement on a line just before the
ones you want ignored, and use the @code{RESUME} statement as the first
statement on a line just after the ones you want ignored.  All lines
between matching @code{IGNORE} - @code{RESUME} statements are totally
ignored.

@code{IGNORE} and @code{RESUME} are the only statements in LUX that are
sensitive to position: they only work if they are the first statement on
the line.  In any other position they are not recognized as statements,
and will, if still used as such, generate errors.  This relatively
peculiar behavior is necessary because you might sometimes want to use
the words "ignore" or "resume" in a literal string or in a comment, and
if LUX is truly ignoring text up to the next matching @code{RESUME} then
it cannot figure out if the next @code{RESUME} it encounters is intended
as a regular @code{RESUME} statement or rather is part of a literal
string or a comment.  One alternative is to check code between
@code{IGNORE}s and matching @code{RESUME}s anyway, so it is clear if a
found @code{RESUME} is a statement or not, but then to ignore the
skipped code by not executing it.  However, then the ignored code would
have to be flawless LUX code or else LUX would get confused anyway.
With the current implementation, ignored lines are like comments.

@code{IGNORE} and @code{RESUME} are not strictly reserved keywords
(@ref{Reserved Keywords}) and may be used as names for variables or
keywords -- as long as they are not the first word on a line.

@section Line Breaks

@cindex Line breaks
@cindex Breaking lines
@cindex Newlines

When LUX reads input from a file, then it can read ahead as much as it
wants to until it can figure out the meaning of something on the line.
Therefore, LUX ignores line breaks (where you start a new line) unless
the line break changes the value or meaning to LUX of something on the
command line.  Also, newlines are important to the @code{IGNORE} and
@code{RESUME} commands (@ref{Ignoring Input}).  Newlines are not allowed
in the middle of a name, such as those of variables (@ref{Variables}),
functions (@ref{Function Definition}, subroutines (@ref{Subroutine
Definition}, and argument keywords (@ref{Argument Specification}); in
the middle of a literal text string (between quotes (@code{'} or
@code{"}); @ref{Strings}) or a number (@ref{Scalars}); or in the middle
of a reserved keyword such as @code{IF} or @code{REPEAT} (@ref{Reserved
Keywords}).  In all other places in LUX files, newlines are allowed.
So, in a LUX file, it is OK to have @code{T,SIN ( 5.3} on one line and
@code{)} on the next line to form a complete command.

When LUX reads input from the keyboard, then it assumes for the most
part that the user intended to finish one or more complete statements
when the user pressed the @kbd{RET} key.  Only in certain cases where a
statement always includes more statements does LUX conclude that the
user wants to give more input on following lines.  These cases are:
after the start of a @code{SUBR}, @code{FUNC}, @code{BLOCK},
@code{BEGIN}, @code{@{}, @code{IF}, @code{CASE}, @code{NCASE},
@code{FOR}, @code{REPEAT}, @code{DO}, or @code{WHILE} statement and the
corresponding end of the statement (@ref{Statements}).  For these
purposes, the start of the statement consists of the keyword listed
before, plus the name of the subroutine, function, or blockroutine (for
@code{SUBR}, @code{FUNC}, or @code{BLOCK}, or the condition (for
@code{IF}).  The "corresponding end" of the statement consists of the
very end of the statement, or of the keywords @code{UNTIL} or
@code{WHILE} (for @code{REPEAT} and @code{DO}).

At the keyboard, the @code{IF} statement presents special problems,
because it may or may not contain an @code{ELSE} clause.  If you specify
an @code{IF} statement at the keyboard without an @code{ELSE} on the
same line as the end of the @code{THEN} clause, then LUX assumes the
statement has no @code{ELSE} clause.

You can explicitly indicate that a newline should be ignored by typing a
continuation character (a minus sign, @code{-}) as the very last
character on the line.  If a minus sign is found as the last character
on a command line (including inside a comment), then the minus sign is
removed, and the contents of the next line are appended to the previous
one before the whole thing is sent to the parser.  Such continuation
characters are not required in files, but are useful when copying and
pasting lines from a file to the command line.

Below are some examples of LUX statements that generate errors when
entered from the keyboard.  It is assumed that the @kbd{RET} key is
pressed at the end of each line.

@example
T,SIN(2.34
)

T,'alphabetical
stuff'

FUNC
MYFUN(x) RETURN,x+2 ENDFUNC

IF x LT 3 THEN T,'OK'
ELSE T,'Not OK'
@end example

In the first example, it is an error not to specify a closing
parenthesis on the same line as the opening one.  In the second example,
a closing quote was expected on the same line as the opening quote.  In
the third example, a function name should follow @code{FUNC} on the same
line.  In the last example, the @code{ELSE} should be on the same line
as the end of the @code{THEN} clause: now LUX will execute the @code{IF}
statement without the @code{ELSE} clause and then complain about the
unexpected @code{ELSE} at the start of the next line.  Except for the
string example, which modifies the value of the string, all of these
examples would not cause problems if they were read from a file.

your screen.  Some produce line graphs, and some display images.  All
routines allow specification of the coordinates where the graphics
should be displayed.

In plotting data or displaying images in a LUX window on your screen,
you can select from various coordinate systems.  These coordinate
systems are listed below.

@table @code
@item DEP
The magnitude-dependent coordinate system.  It corresponds to the
@code{DEV} system if the coordinate is negative or if the magnitude of
the coordinate is greater than or equal to 1, and to the @code{DVI}
system if the magnitude is less than 1.
@item DVI
The device-independent coordinate system.  The origin is in the lower
left-hand corner of the screen, and the coordinates increase toward the
upper right-hand corner, which has coordinates @code{(1,1)}.
@item DEV
The device-dependent coordinate system.  The origin, with coordinates
@code{(0,0)}, is in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and the
coordinates increase toward the upper right-hand corner.  The unit is
one pixel.
@item PLT
The plot coordinate system.  The coordinates increase from left to right
and from bottom to top.  The origin and scale correspond to that of the
last-drawn plot window (i.e., @code{PLT} point @code{(!MXB,!MYB)}
corresponds to @code{DVI} point @code{(!WXB,!WYB)}, and @code{PLT} point
@code{(!MXT,!MYT)} to @code{DVI} point @code{(!WXT,!WYT)}).
@item RPL
The relative plot-coordinate system.  The origin is in the lower
left-hand corner of the last drawn plot window, at @code{DVI} point
@code{(!WXB,!WYB)}, and the coordinates increase to @code{(1,1)} in the
upper right-hand corner of the last drawn plot, at @code{DVI} point
@code{(!WXT,!WYT)}).
@item IMG
The image coordinate system.  By default, the origin is at the lower
left-hand corner of the last displayed image (at @code{DEV} coordinates
@code{(!TVIX,!TVIY)}, and the coordinates increase toward the upper
right-hand corner.  However, if @code{SET,/YREVERSEIMG} has been
executed, then image coordinates are measured using the native
@code{X11} coordinate orientation, with the image origin in the upper
left-hand corner and the coordinates increasing toward the lower
right-hand corner.  The unit is equal to @code{!TVSCALE} pixels.
@item RIM
The relative image-coordinate system.  By default, the origin is at the
lower left-hand corner of the last displayed image (at @code{DEV}
coordinates @code{(!TVIX,!TVIY)}, and the coordinates increase toward
the upper right-hand corner, whose coordinates are @code{(1,1)}.
However, if @code{SET,/YREVERSEIMG} has been executed, then image
coordinates are measured using the native @code{X11} coordinate
orientation, with the image origin in the upper left-hand corner and the
coordinates increasing toward the lower right-hand corner.
@item X11
The native @code{X11} coordinate system, with its origin at the upper
left-hand corner of the window, the y coordinate increasing downward,
and with a unit of one pixel.
@end table

Several graphics routines allow you to specify coordinates as well as
the coordinate system in which these coordinates are expressed.  You
specify a particular coordinate system by including a keyword
corresponding to one of the coordinate system codes listed above, e.g.,
@code{/PLT} for the @code{PLT} coordinate system.  Alternatively, you
can specify the coordinate system numerically through the @code{MODE}
keyword @code{MODE=#COORDSYS.sys} where @code{sys} stands for the
three-letter abbreviation of the coordinate system name.

For example, you can display a box (symbol type @code{-4}) at
coordinates @code{(100,200)} in the @code{IMG} coordinate system through
command @code{XYMOV,100,200,-4,/IMG}, or
@code{XYMOV,100,200,-4,MODE=#COORDSYS.IMG}.  The latter form is more
convenient if you want to allow the user to select a coordinate system
through a parameter of a user-defined subroutine or function.

In older versions of LUX, image positions in routines such as @code{TV}
were specified in a coordinate system that had its origin in the upper
left-hand corner with the y coordinate increasing towards the bottom,
and the position specified for an image was the location of its upper
left-hand corner (the @code{X11} coordinate system).  @code{TV,x,0,0}
would display an image in the upper left-hand corner of the window.  In
the current version of LUX, image positions are specified in the
@code{DEV} coordinate system, and the specified position is the one of
the lower left-hand corner of the image, so @code{TV,x,0,0} displays an
image in the lower left-hand corner of the window.  For backwards
compatibility, one can still request the older-style image coordinate
specification (i.e., the @code{X11} coordinate system) as default, by
executing @code{SET,/ULIMCOORDS}, and the older-style image orientation
(with the image origin in the upper left-hand corner of the image) by
executing @code{SET,/YREVERSEIMG}.

@section Colors

@cindex Colors

In the X window display system used by LUX, a finite number of different
colors can be displayed at any one time.  Depending on your computer
system and the default settings for your window manager, you may be
using any one of the six display methods ("visual classes") offered by
X.  Most users probably have an 8-bit PseudoColor display by default,
which can show 256 distinct colors at any given time, and the
characteristics of this display method are explained below.

The colors available for display at a given time can be thought of as
occupying a finite number of color cells with one color to a cell,
forming a color map.  The finite number (usually 256) of color cells
available in the default color map must be shared between all X window
applications (such as LUX) running at the time.

The human eye can distinguish about one hundred to two hundred shades of
gray, so if LUX has much fewer than 100 color cells available to it,
then images that it displayed would look noticeably artificial.  To
prevent the most egregious of such cases, LUX sets a lower limit of 64
color cells for image display.  LUX also needs some color cells for
incidental colors, such as window background colors, widget button
colors, and line drawing colors.  Also, it is polite not to grab all
remaining color cells, or else other programs that are started after LUX
may complain or fail.  If not enough color cells remain, then LUX
requests a private color map.

If the user explicitly requests a private color map through
@code{XOPEN,/PRIVATE_COLORMAP}, or if less than 96 color cells remain
available in the default color map, then LUX goes for a private color
map, and otherwise for the default color map.  In either case, LUX grabs
all but a few of the remaining color cells for use in displaying images.
The grabbed color cells are referred to as the @emph{color ramp},
because they are initialized with a linear greyscale ramp.  The number
of color cells that are left for incidental colors and for other
applications is equal to one third of the number of color cells in the
color ramp, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 32.  Incidental colors
are allocated from the remaining cells only when the need arises.  If
LUX requests a new incidental color but no more color cells are
available, then it issues a warning and substitutes an already allocated
color instead.

Generally, there is a limit to the number of color maps that can be
active at the same time on a given screen.  If too many color maps are
being used by all of the current applications, then only some of them
will show up correctly (including the one that the pointer -- graphical
cursor -- is in).  For example, if you run LUX on a system where only a
single color map can be active at any given time, and if LUX is using a
private color map, then the terminal window (in which you type LUX
commands) and LUX windows and widgets cannot all be shown with the
correct colors at the same time.  If you move the pointer into a LUX
window, then all LUX windows will be shown with the correct colors, and
if you move the pointer outside of all LUX windows, then the terminal
window and screen background will be shown with the correct colors.

For the PseudoColor visual, the color ramp is a set of color cells
reserved for display of images.  By default, the color ramp is filled
with a greyscale, so that displayed images are greyscale images.  The
user can change the display colors using the @code{TVLCT} command, which
modifies the whole color ramp based on the red, green, and blue values
specified in the @code{TVLCT} command, using linear interpolation.

@subsection Incidental Colors

Specific incidental colors can be requested through the @code{SETFG}
(for the foreground color) and @code{SETBG} (background color) commands
and their aliases.  The foreground color is used also for line drawings
(e.g., @ref{PLOT}) and calligraphy (e.g., @ref{CALLIG}).  The color can
be identified in two ways: through a color name, or through a set of
three numbers.

@code{SETFG,'color-name'} sets the foreground color to that specified by
the @code{color-name} -- if that name is recognized.  Color names can be
either proper names (such as @code{blue} or @code{black}) or various
kinds of color space coordinate "names".  In general, colors can be
identified by three independent numbers, and there are many different
color coordinate systems in use.  You specify a color string in a
particular recognized color coordinate system by constructing a name
that consists of the color coordinate system (case-insensitive) name
followed by a colon @code{:} followed by the three corresponding
coordinates separated by forward slashes @code{/}.

The following two color coordinate systems specify colors in a
device-dependent manner:
@table @asis
@item RGB
@code{'rgb:<red>/<green>/<blue>'} with @code{<red>},
@code{<green>}, and @code{<blue>} three integer numbers consisting of up
to four hexadecimal digits (case insensitive).  The number @code{FFFF}
indicates maximum intensity in that color, and @code{0000} indicates
total absence of that color.  If fewer than four hexadecimal digits are
specified, then hexadecimal zeros are affixed.  In other words, the
following two specifications are equivalent: @code{'rgb:ff/002/3a'} and
@code{'rgb:ff00/0020/3a00'}.
@item RGBI
@code{'rgbi:<red>/<green>/<blue>'} is similar to
@code{'rgb:<red>/<green>/<blue>'} except that the numbers are now
floating point and between 0.0 and 1.0 (with an optional sign and
an optional exponent introduced by @code{e} or @code{E}).
@end table

The following six color coordinate systems specify colors in a
device-independent manner:

@table @asis
@item CIEXYZ
@code{'CIEXYZ:<X>/<Y>/<Z>'}
@item CIEuvY
@code{'CIEuvY:<u>/<v>/<Y>'}
@item CIExyY
@code{'CIExyY:<x>/<y>/<Y>'}
@item CIELab
@code{'CIELab:<L>/<a>/<b>'}
@item CIELuv
@code{'CIELuv:<L>/<u>/<v>'}
@item TekHVC
@code{'TekHVC:<H>/<V>/<C>'}
@end table

The numbers in all of these specifications are floating point, with
optional sign and exponent.

@code{SETFG,[r,g,b]} sets the foreground color to the color defined by
the RGBI values @code{r} (for red), @code{g} (for green), and @code{b}
(for blue).  All three numbers should be floating-point between 0.0
(absent) and 1.0 (maximum).  The specification @code{SETFG,[r,g,b]}
corresponds to @code{SETFG,'rgbi:r/g/b'}.

The standard image display routine is @code{TV}.  It displays the
contents of a two-dimensional numerical array at a user-specified
location in a user-specified window, after optional magnification and
scaled for maximum contrast.  Images are displayed with dimension 0 of
the data increasing to the right, and dimension 1 increasing upward.
Array element @code{(0,0)} is displayed in the lower left-hand corner of
the image.

By default, the position specified for an image is the location of the
lower left-hand corner of the image in @code{DEV} coordinates (See
@ref{Screen Coordinates}).  In older versions of LUX, the upper
left-hand corner was used for this in the native X window coordinate
system.  For backward compatibility, this feature is still available if
you execute @code{SET,/ULIMCOORDS} beforehand.

In the X window display system used by LUX, a finite number of different
colors can be displayed at any one time.  Depending on your computer
system and the default settings for your window manager, you may be
using any one of the six display methods ("visual classes") offered by
X.  Most users probably have an 8-bit PseudoColor display by default,
which can show 256 distinct colors at any given time, and the
characteristics of this display method are explained below.

The colors available for display at a given time can be thought of as
occupying a finite number of color cells with one color to a cell,
forming a color map.  The finite number (usually 256) of color cells
available in the default color map must be shared between all X window
applications (such as LUX) running at the time.  If LUX finds that not
enough color cells remain in the default color map, then it requests its
own private color map (@ref{Colors}).

When you display an image in a LUX window using the @code{TV} routine,
then three transformations are performed to translate an image value
into a color: First the data value is scaled linearly to a @code{BYTE}
index into the available color range, using the @code{SCALE} function.
The lowest image value is scaled to @code{!SCALEMIN} and the highest one
to @code{!SCALEMAX}.  These two variables are set to 0 and 255,
respectively, when color cells are first allocated, but they may be
changed by the user.

Next, the color range values are translated into indices into the color
map.  LUX has no control over exactly which color map elements are
allocated to it, and in what order, so the color map indices of the
color cells allocated to LUX need not form a contiguous or ordered set,
and need not be the same from LUX session to LUX session even if the
same number of color cells are allocated by LUX in those different
sessions.  Color cell indices between 0 (inclusive) and the number of
color cells (exclusive) that was allocated by LUX are guaranteed to
correspond to colors allocated by LUX, but there is no such guarantee
for any particular color map index.

Finally, the color map indices are translated into particular colors
through the color table.  By default, LUX's color table ranges regularly
from black (color cell index 0) to white (highest color cell index).
You can specify an alternative color map with the @code{TVLCT} routine.

If you wish to suppress the first or first two of these transformations,
then use the @code{TVMAP} or @code{TVRAW} routines instead of @code{TV}.
@code{TVMAP} assumes that the @code{BYTE} image contains LUX color cell
indices, and @code{TVRAW} assumes the @code{BYTE} image contains color
map indices.

@section Widgets

NOTE: These are just being implemented, so the following descriptions is
likely incomplete!

Standard exchange of information (input or output) with LUX goes through
the terminal window (basic) or through LUX windows (if the @code{X11}
package has been included).  In addition, basic menus are available in
the @code{X11} package.

Widgets allow a greater variety of input/output methods, including
buttons and more advanced pull-down menus.  LUX widgets are (currently)
implemented using Motif.  You can only use widgets in LUX if the
@code{MOTIF} and @code{X11} packages have been included in the LUX
compilation, and if the Motif widgets are installed on your system.

The Motif widgets themselves are not part of LUX, just like X11 is not
part of LUX.  LUX merely offers ways of manipulating the Motif widgets
-- if they are present on your system.  For information about the
availability or installation of Motif, consult your system manager.

If you want to use your own widgets, then first you have to build the
widgets (i.e., specify what goes in them and where, and what is supposed
to happen if the user does something to one of their elements), and then
you have to manage the widgets (i.e., wait for the user to do something
to the widgets, and then act accordingly).

@subsection Building Widgets

In LUX, widgets are identified by @emph{widget identification numbers}
or @emph{widget IDs}, which are small positive integer numbers.  Widgets
are part of a hierarchy with one or more top-level widgets, and zero or
more other widgets that are dependent parts of widgets higher up in the
hierarchy.  For convenience, widget associations are referred to as if
dependent widgets are the offspring of widgets that contain them.

Widget dependency is such that if a particular widget is destroyed
(removed), then all of its children are removed, too.  Top-level widgets
stand out because they have no ancestors.

The following top-level widgets are currently available:
@code{XMMESSAGE}, @code{XMPROMPT}, @code{XMTOPLEVEL_BOARD}, and
@code{XMTOPLEVEL_FORM}.  The last two can contain children.

In a bulletin board widget, child widgets can be placed at absolute
positions, using @ref{XMPOSITION}.  In a form widget, child widget
placement is constrained by specifying widget attachments through
@ref{XMATTACH}.  In both types of widgets, convenient placement can also
be achieved by including child widgets in row or column widgets, using
@ref{XMROWS} or @ref{XMCOLUMNS}.

computer program failure was sometimes due to the presence of insects
(commonly referred to as "bugs") in the computer.

@subsection Parser Errors

If something goes wrong during compilation of your statements because
you typed something that LUX does not understand, then by default LUX
tries to indicate in detail what it is confused about and where it found
the confusing code, by displaying a parser message.  For example, if you
type the command @code{FOR DO}, then LUX complains, because @code{DO} is
a reserved keyword so it cannot be the name of an identifier, and yet
LUX expects an identifier after @code{FOR}.  The complete message is:
@example
parse error, expecting `COMMON_IDENTIFIER' in line 1: "for do"
(main): 1: Error just before ""
Illegal statement
@end example
This message explains what kind of input LUX was expecting (see below),
what line (and, if necessary, what file) the offending code is in, the
offending code itself, perhaps some additional information about which
bit exactly caused confusion, and finally a verdict about the error
("Illegal statement", in this case).

The next example shows the error message generated by the command
@code{X=SIN(3} (i.e., with the closing parenthesis missing):
@example
parse error, expecting `error' or `','' or `')'' in line 3: "x=sin(3"
(main): 3: Error just before end of line
Unbalanced ()
@end example

The kinds of things that a parse error message can list as being
expected include single characters, such as the comma or closing
parenthesis in the previous example (don't mind the confusing quotes
around them), particular kinds of expressions such as
@code{COMMON_IDENTIFIER} (any valid name for a variable that starts with
a letter) or @code{SPECIAL_IDENTIFIER} (any valid name for a global
variable that starts with one character from @code{$ ! #}), or the
curious item @code{error}, which you can ignore.

@subsection Execution Errors

If something goes wrong during execution of your statements, then LUX
tries to indicate in detail what went wrong and where, by displaying an
error message.  The error message lists the file or routine that the
error occurred in, the line number within that file or (user-defined)
routine, the offending piece of LUX code, a message specifying what
error occurred, and successively wider contexts of the error, all the
way up to the complete statement.

For example, if you type @code{T,SQRT('alpha')} then you'll generate an
error message because LUX cannot take the square root of a string.  The
error message is
@example
(main),  2| 'alpha': Argument is of an illegal class
  2| SQRT('alpha')
----------^
  2| SQRT('alpha')
  2| T,SQRT('alpha') 
@end example
This message indicates that the error occurred at the main execution
level (outside of any file or user-defined routine) in line number 2,
that the offending piece of code was the string @code{'alpha'}, and that
it is of an illegal class for this operation.  The remaining lines show
the position of the piece of offending code in successively wider
contexts, up to the complete statement.

@chapter Calculator Mode

@cindex Calculator mode

LUX mimics a regular calculator if you enter calculator mode using the
@code{CALCULATOR} command.  You can only enter this mode from the main
execution level (i.e., not from inside a subroutine or function).  This
mode is indicated by the @code{clc>} prompt, and you can leave it again
by issuing a @code{RETURN} command.

In calculator mode, you modify the value of variable @code{$} by issuing
calculator commands.  The value must be a numerical scalar or array, or
a string.  After each command has been completed, the current value of
@code{$} is displayed.  Each command is ended by a newline and consists
of a LUX expression or simple assignment implicitly or explicitly
containing @code{$} as an operand.  This variable is an implicit operand
in the following cases: binary operations where the first operand is
missing, simple assignments where the left-hand side is missing, and
simple assignments that consist of just the name of a single-argument
function (which is applied to the value of @code{$}).

If a command consists of just a single name, then it is taken to be the
name of a single-argument function that is to be applied to the current
value.  If you wish to assign the value of a variable, then prepend an
equal sign.

@subsubsection Arrays with Pseudo-Random Numbers

@cindex Random numbers
@cindex Pseudo-random numbers
@cindex Numbers, random

LUX offers various functions that return @emph{pseudo-random} numbers.
These numbers are determined by a fixed deterministic algorithm, so the
numbers are not random in the sense that nobody can know which number
will be generated next.  A main advantage of using a deterministic
algorithm is that of reproducibility: If you restart the algorithm with
the same starting conditions, then it produces the same sequence of
numbers.

Of course, to be useful, the pseudo-random numbers generated by the
algorithm must share a sufficient number of properties with truly random
numbers.  For instance, the number of pseudo-random numbers in any given
interval of values must be statistically indistinguishable from those in
a truly random sequence, and the correlation between any two
pseudo-random numbers at a fixed distance of each other in the
pseudo-random sequence should be statistically zero.

The method used by LUX to generate pseudo-random numbers (other than
random bits) is the MT19937 ``Mersenne Twister'' generator of Makoto
Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura, which has a period of 2^19937 - 1 and
passes most statistical tests.  LUX generates random bits using a
primitive polynomial modulo 2.

The pseudo-random number functions LUX offers are:

@example
RANDOMB( [SEED = @var{seed},] @var{dimensions})
RANDOMD( [SEED = @var{seed},] @var{distribution}, @var{dimensions})
RANDOME( @var{scale}, @var{dimensions})
RANDOMU( [SEED = @var{seed}, PERIOD = @var{period},] @var{dimensions})
RANDOMN( [SEED = @var{seed},] @var{dimensions})
RANDOM( [SEED = @var{seed}, PERIOD = @var{period},] @var{dimensions}
        [, /UNIFORM, /NORMAL, /SAMPLE, /SHUFFLE, /BITS])
@end example

The @code{RANDOMB} function returns random bits.  The @code{RANDOMU}
function returns uniformly distributed integer or floating-point
numbers.  The @code{RANDOMN} function returns numbers normally
distributed with zero average and unit variance.  The @code{RANDOMD}
function returns integer numbers distributed according to a
user-specified distribution.  The @code{RANDOME} function returns
numbers exponentially distributed across the whole range of
representable numbers.  The @code{RANDOM} function selects a
distribution by keyword.  @code{RANDOMU} is an alias of
@code{RANDOM,/UNIFORM}, and @code{RANDOMN} is an alias of
@code{RANDOM,/NORMAL}.

The frame bias matrix @code{@var{rb}} transforms vectors from Geocentric
Celestial Reference System to the J2000.0 mean equator and equinox by
applying frame bias.  It does not depend on the date.

The precession matrix @code{@var{rp}} transforms vectors from the J2000.0
mean equator and equinox to the mean equator and equinox of the date
by applying precession.

The bias-precession matrix @code{@var{rbp}} transforms vectors from
Geocentric Celestial Reference System to the mean equator and equinox
of the date by applying frame bias and then precession.
@code{@var{rbp} = @var{rp} # @var{rb}}

@table @asis
@item @ref{DUMP_STACK}
Show the contents of the stack.
@item @ref{POP}
Pop values from the stack.
@item @ref{PUSH}
Push values on the stack.
@end table

@code{PUSH,a,b} pushes @code{a} and @code{b} onto the stack in that
order, so that @code{b} ends up on top of the stack.  The contents of
the stack are listed in reverse order of pushing (i.e., the last pushed
one is listed first) by @code{DUMP_STACK}.  The @code{POP} routine pops
values from the stack.  Arguments to @code{POP} that are named variables
receive successive values from the stack, so that after @code{PUSH,a,b},
@code{POP,c,d} restores the pushed value of @code{a} into @code{c}, and
the pushed value of @code{b} into @code{d}.  Arguments that are unnamed
must reduce to a number, and that number of values are then popped from
the stack into their original named source variables.  So, after
@code{PUSH,a,b}, @code{POP,2} restores @code{a} and @code{b} from the
stack.  If you want to restore the number of elements that is contained
in a named variable @code{n}, then use @code{POP,NUM=n}.  An argument to
keyword @code{NUM} is always treated first.

You can mix named variables and unnamed values in the argument list of
@code{POP}.  Named variables are treated in blocks, unnamed values are
treated one by one.  For example, @code{POP,a,b,3,c,d,e} restores first
to @code{b}, then to @code{a}, then three elements to their original
sources, then to @code{e}, then to @code{d}, and finally to @code{c}.

One of the strengths of LUX is that it often allows you to specify which
dimension or dimensions to apply a certain routine to, so that you do
not need to treat each part of the data separately.  Currently, the
following routines allow you to specify which dimension or dimensions
they should be applied to:

@ref{BISECT}, @ref{BSMOOTH}, @ref{DIFFER}, @ref{DIMEN}, @ref{DSUM},
@ref{ESMOOTH}, @ref{FFT}, @ref{FSUM}, @ref{GSMOOTH}, @ref{HILBERT},

@cindex Installing LUX

You can obtain the LUX source code at @code{http://lux.quae.nl}.  The
distribution comes in one compressed tar file called
@file{lux-1.0.tar.gz} (if the version is 1.0).  To compile LUX, follow
the instructions given below (with @code{%} introducing a command line
to type in, do not type the @code{%} itself).

@enumerate
@item
Extract the sources from the distribution file:
@example
% tar xzf lux-1.0.tar.gz
@end example

A subdirectory @file{lux-1.0} is created and filled with all necessary
source files.

@item
Go into the source directory:

@example
% cd lux-1.0
@end example

@item
Configure for compilation on your system:

@example
% ./configure
@end example

Your system is investigated for various peculiarities, and various
necessary additional files are created, tailored to your system.  To
see all options of @code{configure}, do

@example
% ./configure --help
@end example

@item
Compile the source files in the local directory:

@example
% make
@end example

If all goes well, an executable @file{lux} is generated in the
@file{src} subdirectory.

@item
To run the tests provided with LUX, execute

@example
% make check
@end example

@item
If you want to make LUX available to all users on the system, then
type

@example
% make install
@end example

You may need administrative privileges for this, unless you specified
a @code{--prefix} on the @code{./configure} command that points to a
directory of your own; do @code{./configure --help} for details.

By default, the executable is installed as @code{/usr/local/bin/lux},
the documentation is installed as
@code{/usr/local/share/doc/lux.info*}.

You can read the documentation using

@example
% info lux
@end example

and also using the @code{HELP} command from inside LUX.

@chapter The LUX Environment

@cindex Environment variables
@cindex LUXDIR
@cindex LUX_PATH
@cindex LUXDRIVE
@cindex LUXFONTSDIR

LUX needs to know where certain auxilliary files and devices are located
on your computer system.  To that end, you need to specify some
environment variables in your computer's operating system.  LUX will
read those environment variables when it needs to find one of the files
or devices.

LUX may inspect the following environment variables:
@table @code
@item LUX_PATH
This variable should contain a list of names of the directories where
LUX is to search for user-defined LUX scripts (e.g., user definitions of
routines and functions) .  The directories must be separated by colons
(@code{:}).
@item LUXDIR
This variable should contain the name of the directory where the LUX help
file @file{lux.texi} is stored.
@item LUXFONTSDIR
This variable should contain the path where the LUX font files
(@file{font003.hex0} and similar other ones) can be found, if that
path is not @file{/usr/share/lux} or @file{/usr/local/share/lux}.
@item LUXDRIVE0, LUXDRIVE1, @dots{}
These variables should contain the names of external storage devices
such as tape drives.  The device linked to the name @code{LUXDRIVE0} is
accessed as tape drive 0 in LUX, and @code{LUXDRIVE1} links to tape
drive 1, etcetera.
@end table

The @code{make} command, when used in LUX's source directory, generates
a shell script @file{.luxenv} that contains definitions for these
environment variables.  The definition for @code{LUXDIR} in that script
is correct after you install the relevant LUX files through @code{make
install}.  The definitions for @code{LUX_PATH} and @code{LUXDRIVE0} in
that script are examples.

You are welcome to set the environment variables yourself.  How you
specify environment variables depends on your operating system, and
these variables may have a different name on different operating
systems.  On a UNIX-like system (Unix, Ultrix, Linux, Irix, Solaris,
etc.), you specify environment variables as shown in the following
examples:

Using tcsh, csh:
@example
setenv LUX_PATH         ".:~/lux/lib:~/lux/slib"
setenv LUXDRIVE0        "/dev/rmt/0n"
@end example

Using sh, ksh, or bash:
@example
LUX_PATH=".:~/lux/lib:~/lux/slib"
LUXDRIVE0="/dev/rmt/0n"
@end example

@chapter LUX's History

@cindex History of LUX

LUX is a fork of ANA.  ANA was originally designed to process data
from the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite, which flew in the
early 1980s.  It was implemented for the VAX VMS operating system in
assembly code and a little bit of Fortran mostly by Richard Shine (of
the then Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory, nowadays known as the
Lockheed Martin Solar & Astrophysics Laboratory) in Palo Alto,
California.

Around 1990, Richard Shine converted the assembly code to C code and
ported ANA to SGI's Irix operating system.  At that time, Louis Strous
at Utrecht University in the Netherlands took the Irix copy and ported
it to Dec Ultrix.  Shine and Strous have mostly independently improved
ANA since then, leading to divergent versions of ANA with a common
subset of capabilities.

In 1994, Strous rewrote ANA's parser and compiler, replacing the old
parser with a new one, using GNU's bison parser generator.  The new
parser and compiler allowed simple addition of new features to the
language, such as keywords arguments and subscripting of expressions.

Between 1994 and 1999, the Shine and Strous versions of ANA drifted
apart somewhat.  In early 1999, Strous produced a version (ANA 3) that
is supposedly backwardly compatible with both the older Shine and
Strous versions.  Since that time, the two versions have diverged
again.

In 2013, Strous renamed his version of ANA to LUX to avoid confusion.

@cindex Reference Manual

This chapter lists all built-in subroutines, functions, status
functions, and global variables that are available in LUX.

If the text describing such an item starts with a bracketed word such as
@code{[X11]}, then the item depends on the one or more specialized
capabilities, such as additional software packages, that are not
available on all systems.  For a list of these packages, see
@ref{Packages}.

A code such as @code{[3.1.321]} at the very end of an entry indicates
the version number (@code{3.1}) and patch level number (@code{321}) at
which the routine described in the entry was last changed.  If your
version of LUX is older, then not all features described for this entry
may be supported by it.

@cindex Packages of routines, functions, and global variables
@cindex Availability of routines, functions, and global variables

Not all computers are the same, and not all operating systems offer the
same capabilities and under the same names, though there is an extensive
set of standard capabilities with standard names.  Those subroutines,
functions, status functions, and global variables that require
capabilities that your computer system does not offer cannot be made
available in your version of LUX.  When you're installing LUX, then the
configuration script tests your system to see which key capabilities it
has and which ones it lacks, and routines and such are correspondingly
included or omitted from your version of LUX.

We say that those routines and such that depend on the availability of a
certain key capability are part of the same @emph{package}.  Some
routines may be part of more than one package.  Below, we list the
packages that are currently recognized.

@subsection @code{[DEBUG]}

The @code{[DEBUG]} package contains subroutines and functions that are
useful to program developers to debug the LUX program itself; i.e., to
discover why some aspect of LUX is not reacting as advertised.  These
routines are generally of no interest to the user of LUX.  This package
is included if the @code{--enable-debug} option is given to
@code{./configure}.  Besides including some routines and functions, this
selection also replaces certain internal routines that deal with
requests for and release of memory areas with versions that allow
program developers to check for mistakes in these matters.  These
replacement versions are @emph{much} slower than their non-debugging
versions.

The @code{[DEVELOP]} package contains subroutines and functions that are
still in development.  These items may contain serious errors, may be
unfinished, and may yet be removed if they turn out not to be as useful
as the developers hoped!  Use them at your own risk.  You include this
package by specifying the @code{--enable-develop} option to

@subsection @code{[MOTIF]}

The @code{[MOTIF]} package contains those subroutines and functions that
deal with widgets.  Currently, LUX uses the @code{Motif} library to
generate widgets, because of its widespread use and availability.
However, this library is not part of LUX itself, but must be obtained
separately from a commercial company.  If a viable non-commercial
alternative becomes widely available, and if the authors find the time,
then they may switch to such an alternative.

The @code{[MOTIF]} package is contained in the @code{[X11]} package.
The @code{[MOTIF]} package is included automatically it is detected on
your computer system, and if also the @code{[X11]} package is included,
unless you specify the @code{--without-motif} option to
@code{./configure}.

All of LUX's built-in functions and subroutines are described below.
Functions are followed by the list of comma-separated arguments, if any,
between parentheses.  Subroutines are followed by the comma-separated
list of arguments, if any, separated from the subroutine name by a
comma.  Arguments between square brackets are optional.  Arguments
followed by three dots may be repeated zero or more times.  Generally,
the user may specify any number of the optional arguments, provided no
unspecified argument precedes any specified argument between the same
square brackets.

Arguments that are indicated in one of the following two manners are
keyword arguments: @code{/KEYWORD} or @code{KEYWORD=@code{@var{value}}}.
These arguments may be specified in any order and in any position, and
their placement does not influence the interpretation of non-keyword
arguments.

@code{AREA, @var{bitmap}} identifies all disjoint areas in @code{LONG}
array @code{@var{bitmap}} (of arbitrary dimensions) which have elements
with value one.  Elements with values equal to zero or greater than one
are disregarded.  Negative values are used internally to indicate
intermediate processing states, so these must not be present in
@code{@var{bitmap}}!  The identified areas in @code{@var{bitmap}} are
filled with a number which uniquely label them.

If @code{@var{seed}} is specified, then it is assumed to contain indices
to @code{@var{bitmap}} at which areas are to be sought.  In that case,
only the areas found at those positions are identified.

If @code{@var{number}} is specified, then it is assumed to contain area
numbers to assign to the areas found at the corresponding positions from
@code{@var{seed}}.  @code{@var{number}} must have either one element or
the same number as @code{@var{seed}}.  In the former case, area numbers
are incremented by one, starting at the value of @code{@var{number}}.
If no @code{@var{number}} is specified, then assigned area numbers start
at 2.

If @code{@var{diagonal}} is specified, then it must have one element per
data dimension and is taken as instructions on which nearest-neighbor
connections to recognize.  A 2 means that nearest neighbors with their
@code{@var{bitmap}} values equal to 1 are assigned to the same area if
they share any face or vertex in the corresponding dimension.  A 1 means
that such neighbors are assigned to the same area only if they share a
face in the corresponding dimension.  A 0 means that connections in the
corresponding dimension are ignored.  If @code{@var{diagonal}} is not
specified, then code 2 is assumed for all dimensions.

For example, if @code{@var{diagonal}} is equal to @code{[2, 2, 0]}, then
no connections in the third dimension are recognized, and the data is
treated as a set of unconnected two-dimensional images (but no area in
any of these images shares its area number with any area in any of the
other images).  Within each of the images, connections in all four
directions (N-S, E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE) are recognized in this case.  If
@code{@var{diagonal}} is equal to @code{[1, 1, 0]}, then only directions
in the orthogonal directions (N-S, E-W) are recognized.  Likewise for
@code{[2, 1, 0]}, because even though the first dimension allowes
vertices, the second one only accepts faces.

If @code{AREA} is called with @code{@var{bitmap}} a two-dimensional
@code{LONG} array and with no other arguments, then a special-purpose
version of the routine is called which is optimized for this case for
speed.  Otherwise, a more versatile but somewhat slower version is used.

On an SGI R5000 (200 MHz) running Irix, for 2D data, the special-purpose
version takes about 0.14 microseconds (27 CPU cycles) per data element,
and the general version about 0.15 microseconds (30 CPU cycles) per data
element.  If the special-purpose version cannot be speeded up more, then
it may be discarded.

@code{AREA2, @var{bitmap}, @var{data} [, SEED=@var{seeds},
NUMBERS=@var{numbers}, DIAGONAL=@var{diagonal}, SIGN=@var{sign}]}

@code{AREA2, @var{bitmap}, @var{data}} identifies all disjoint areas in
@code{LONG} array @code{@var{bitmap}} (of arbitrary dimensions) which
have elements with value one, guided by the data values in numerical
array @code{@var{data}}, which must have one element for each element of
@code{@var{bitmap}}.  Elements with values equal to zero or greater than
one in @code{@var{bitmap}} are disregarded.  Negative values are used
internally to indicate intermediate processing states, so these must not
be present in @code{@var{bitmap}}!  The identified areas in
@code{@var{bitmap}} are filled with a number which uniquely label them.

Those elements of @code{@var{bitmap}} with values equal to 1 are
assigned to the same area that (1) share a vertex or face, according to
@code{@var{diagonal}} (see below), and (2) are linked to the same local
appropriate extreme through steepest-gradient paths.  If
@code{@var{sign}} is specified and negative, then links to local minima
are sought, otherwise to local maxima.  The second criterion ensures
that any given area contains at most one local extreme of the desired
kind.

If @code{@var{seed}} is specified, then it is assumed to contain indices
to @code{@var{bitmap}} at which areas are to be sought.  In that case,
only the areas found at those positions are identified.

If @code{@var{number}} is specified, then it is assumed to contain area
numbers to assign to the areas found at the corresponding positions from
@code{@var{seed}}.  @code{@var{number}} must have either one element or
the same number as @code{@var{seed}}.  In the former case, area numbers
are incremented by one, starting at the value of @code{@var{number}}.
If no @code{@var{number}} is specified, then assigned area numbers start
at 2.

If @code{@var{diagonal}} is specified, then it must have one element per
data dimension and is taken as instructions on which nearest-neighbor
connections to recognize.  A 2 means that nearest neighbors with their
@code{@var{bitmap}} values equal to 1 are assigned to the same area if
they share any face or vertex in the corresponding dimension.  A 1 means
that such neighbors are assigned to the same area only if they share a
face in the corresponding dimension.  A 0 means that connections in the
corresponding dimension are ignored.  If @code{@var{diagonal}} is not
specified, then code 2 is assumed for all dimensions.

For example, if @code{@var{diagonal}} is equal to @code{[2, 2, 0]}, then
no connections in the third dimension are recognized, and the data is
treated as a set of unconnected two-dimensional images (but no area in
any of these images shares its area number with any area in any of the
other images).  Within each of the images, connections in all four
directions (N-S, E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE) are recognized in this case.  If
@code{@var{diagonal}} is equal to @code{[1, 1, 0]}, then only directions
in the orthogonal directions (N-S, E-W) are recognized.  Likewise for
@code{[2, 1, 0]}, because even though the first dimension allowes
vertices, the second one only accepts faces.

If @code{@var{bitmap}} is a 2D array, and no @code{@var{seed}},
@code{@var{numbers}}, or @code{@var{diagonal}} is specified, then a
special-purpose version optimized for speed is used.  Otherwise, a more
general-purpose version is used.  On an SGI R5000 (200 MHz) running
Irix, for 2D data, the special-purpose version takes about 0.11
microseconds (23 CPU cycles) per data element, and the general-purpose
version about 0.12 microseconds (24 CPU cycles).

@subsection AREACONNECT
@findex AREACONNECT

@code{AREACONNECT(@var{data1}, @var{data2} [, @var{compact}] [, /RAW])}

Determines connections between areas in data @code{@var{data1}} and
@code{@var{data2}}, based on spatial overlap.  The data must be arrays
of type @code{LONG}.  Each element of @code{@var{data1}} must contain a
number that identifies the area or class that the element is a part of,
for example determined by @code{AREA}, and likewise for
@code{@var{data2}}.  A data value equal to zero is regarded as
background, and data elements with zeros in both @code{@var{data1}} and
@code{@var{data2}} are ignored altogether.

The data elements with any particular area number need not form a
contiguous set; a particular data element from @code{@var{data1}} is
only compared to the corresponding data element from @code{@var{data2}},
and to no others.  The numbers in @code{@var{data1}} are independent of
the numbers in @code{@var{data2}}: No special relationship is inferred
if some area in @code{@var{data1}} has the same ID number as some area
in @code{@var{data2}}.

The return value of this function is a two-dimensional @code{LONG} array
with 3 elements in its second dimension.  If we call that array
@code{R}, then @code{R(*,0)} contains area numbers from
@code{@var{data1}}, @code{R(*,1)} contains area numbers from
@code{@var{data2}}, and @code{R(*,2)} contains the number of data
elements that have that combination of @code{@var{data1}} and
@code{@var{data2}} numbers.  Data elements that have a value of zero in
both data arrays are ignored.  The results are sorted fi
st in ascending
order of @code{@var{data1}} values, and then, for entries with equal
@code{@var{data1}} values, in ascending order of @code{@var{data2}}
values.

If @code{/RAW} is specified, then nothing more is done.  Otherwise, the
areas are divided into topological classes and relevant information is
returned in global variables, as listed in the following table.  If
there are no entries in any particular topological class, then a scalar
@code{@minus{}1} is returned in the corresponding global variable.
Otherwise, a @code{LONG} array is returned.

@table @asis
@item @code{$APP}
Those areas that have non-zero @code{@var{data2}} values but no non-zero
@code{@var{data1}} values are appearing.  Their @code{@var{data2}} area
numbers are returned in ascending order in @code{$APP}.
@item @code{$DISAPP}
Those areas that have non-zero @code{@var{data1}} values but no non-zero
@code{@var{data2}} values are disappearing.  Their @code{@var{data1}}
area numbers are returned in ascending order in @code{$DISAPP}.
@item @code{$SPLIT1}, @code{$SPLIT2}, @code{$SPLIT2_INDEX}
Those @code{@var{data1}} areas that have overlap with more than one
@code{@var{data2}} area are splitting.  Their @code{@var{data1}} (i.e.,
pre-split) area numbers are returned in ascending order in
@code{$SPLIT1}.  The @code{@var{data2}} (i.e., post-split) area numbers
corresponding to pre-split @code{@var{data1}} area number
@code{$SPLIT1(I)} are given, in ascending order, by @code{$SPLIT2
( $SPLIT2_INDEX(I) : $SPLIT2_INDEX(I + 1) - 1)}.
@item @code{$MERGE1}, @code{$MERGE2}, @code{$MERGE1_INDEX}
Those @code{@var{data2}} areas that have overlap with more than one
@code{@var{data1}} area are the product of merging.  Their
@code{@var{data2}} (i.e., post-merge) area numbers are returned in
ascending order in @code{$MERGE2}.  The @code{@var{data1}} (i.e.,
pre-merge) area numbers corresponding to post-merge @code{@var{data2}}
area number @code{$MERGE2(I)} are given, in ascending order, by
@code{$MERGE1( $MERGE1_INDEX(I) : $MERGE1_INDEX(I + 1) - 1)}. 
@item @code{$STAY1}, @code{$STAY2}
Those areas that neither appear, disappear, merge, nor split, are
staying topologically the same.  Their @code{@var{data1}} area numbers
are returned in ascending order in @code{$STAY1}, and the corresponding
@code{@var{data2}} area numbers in @code{$STAY2}.
@end table

At this point, the area numbers in @code{@var{data2}} are not related to
the area numbers in @code{@var{data1}}, so even areas that remain
topologically the same from @code{@var{data1}} to @code{@var{data2}} do
not have the same area number in both data sets.  Such a relation can be
requested by specifying an appropriate value for @code{@var{compact}},
in which case the values in @code{@var{data2}} and related global
variables are modified to best express their relation to
@code{@var{data1}}.  The numbers in @code{@var{data1}} and related
global variables are not modified.

If @code{@var{compact}} is unspecified, negative, or equal to @code{0},
then nothing is modified.  Otherwise, the @code{@var{data2}} areas in
the class of stayers receive the corresponding number from
@code{@var{data1}} (so that @code{$STAY2} becomes equal to
@code{$STAY1}).  For splitters, the first of the @code{@var{data2}}
split products inherits the area number of the @code{@var{data1}} source
area, so that @code{$SPLIT2($SPLIT2_INDEX)} becomes equal to
@code{$SPLIT1}.  For mergers, the @code{@var{data1}} area number of the
first merger component is propagated to the @code{@var{data2}} merger
product, unless that area number was already used earlier, in which case
the remaining merger components are inspected until an unused area
number is found or the last component was dismissed.

After this process (if @code{@var{compact}} is positive), there may
still be some @code{@var{data2}} areas that have not yet received a new
number.  If @code{@var{compact}} is equal to @code{1}, then those areas
receive successive numbers starting at one greater than the greatest
number in @code{@var{data1}}.  If @code{@var{compact}} is equal to
@code{2}, then those areas receive numbers that are as small as possible
but not yet otherwise used in @code{@var{data2}} and not less than 2.
If @code{@var{compact}} is greater than 2, then those areas receive
successive numbers starting at one greater than the value of
@code{@var{compact}} or the greatest number in @code{@var{data1}},
whichever is greater.

the Earth, 4 for Mars, 5 for Jupiter, 6 for Saturn, 7 for Uranus, 8 for
Neptune, 10 for the Moon.  If object numbers not listed here are
specified, then orbital data is sought in an auxilliary file, as
discussed below. 
@item object0
number of the object relative to which the other coordinates are
requested, if any.
@item observer
[North latitude/degrees, West longitude/degrees, height/m] of the
observer.  If none is specified, then the observer is assumed to
reside at the center of the planet.
@item equinox
The year of the equinox relative to which the results are returned.
If a scalar, then the unit is Julian years, with (J) 2000.0 equivalent
to JDE 2451545.0.  If a string, then the first character must be
either a j or J (indicating Julian years), or a b or B (indicating
Besselian years).  The equinox of the date can be requested through
the /DATE keyword.
@item elements
A nine-element array containing orbital elements for the target object.
The elements are, if @code{/QELEMENTS} is also specified: the equinox,
the epoch, the perihelion distance, the eccentricity, the inclination,
the longitude of the ascending node, the argument of the perihelion, the
time of the perihelion, and the absolute magnitude.  If
@code{/QELEMENTS} is not specified, then the length of the semimajor
axis replaces the perihelion distance and the mean anomaly at the epoch
replaces the time of perihelion.  The times are in JDE, the angles in
degrees, the distances in AU.
@end table

@table @code
@item /DATE
selects the equinox of the date.
@item /XYZ
selects return of X Y Z coordinates in AU.  If @code{/XYZ} is not
specified, then polar coordinates are returned (right
ascension/longitude in degrees, declination/latitude in degrees, and
distance in AU). 
@item /EQUATORIAL
return equatorial coordinates (based on the celestial equator).
@item /ECLIPTICAL
return ecliptical coordinates (based on the ecliptic).
@item /HORIZONTAL
return azimuth (West from South) and height (in degrees), and distance
(in AU). 
@item /ELONGATION
return elongation (angular distance to Sun) in degrees, phase angle (angular
distance of observer to Sun as seen from target object) in degrees, and
estimated visual magnitude (which may be wildly off for geometries
unlike those seen from Earth).
@item /TDT
selects dates in TDT (terrestrial dynamical time) rather than
UT.  The difference between TDT (a time based on planetary motion) and
UT (a time based on the Earth's rotation) varies slowly with time.  LUX
uses a quadratic fit to past estimates of the difference to calculate an
estimated difference for the times you specify.  All the planetary
calculations are performed in TDT.
@item /LIGHTTIME
selects inclusion of light-time effects: the returned coordinates say
where the target object was at the time when light left it to reach
the observer at time @code{@var{jds}}.
@item /ABERRATION
selects inclusion of aberration effects.
@item /NUTATION
selects inclusion of nutation effects.
@item /APPARENT
selects return of apparent positions, including the effects of
light-time, aberration, and nutation.
@item /QELEMENTS
indicates that @code{@var{elements}} is specified in terms of the
perihelion (i.e., comet-style) rather than the semimajor axis (i.e.,
planet-style).
@item /FK5
returns coordinates relative to the FK5 system.  If @code{/NOFK5} is
specified, then the coordinates are referred to the mean dynamical
ecliptic defined by the VSOP system.
@item /CONJSPREAD
return the average position (ecliptical longitude and latitude) and
the the conjunction spread of all indicated objects, measured in
degrees.  The conjunction spread is a measure for how close together
all indicated objects are in the sky.  For two close objects, the
conjunction spread is practically equal to their mutual distance.  For
many objects on a great circle (e.g., planets on the ecliptic), the
conjunction spread is equal to twice the standard deviation of their
positions along the great circle.
@item /KEEPDIMENSIONS
returns dimensions for the number of objects and number of dates even
if these are equal to 1.
@item /VOCAL
makes the routine print intermediate results.
@item /VSOP87A
selects the VSOP87A model (cartesian heliocentric coordinates for
J2000.0) to base the results on.
@item /VSOP87C
selects the VSOP87C model (cartesian heliocentric coordinates for the
equinox of the date) to base the results on.
@end table

If objects not listed above are indicated in @code{@var{objects}} and/or
@code{@var{object0}}, then data for such objects are sought in
auxilliary files.  Such files can be read using the @code{READORBITS}
routine.  If no such files have yet been read when needed, then file
@file{$LUXDIR/orbits} is attempted.

If the requested time falls outside of the time period spanned by the
data lines for the indicated object, then the orbital parameters closest
in time to the desired time are used.  Otherwise, linear interpolation
between the two orbits that are closest in time on either side to the
desired time is performed.

[SOFA] Returns the frame bias components of the IAU 2000
precession-nutation models (part of MHB2000 with additions), in a
3-element @code{DOUBLE} array.  The elements are: (0) the longitude
correction in radians, (1) the obliquity correction in radians, (2)
the ICRS right ascension of the J2000.0 mean equinox in radians.

The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity define a J2000.0
mean pole in Geocentric Celestial Reference System coordinates,
consistent with the rest of the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.
The right ascension correction is not part of the IAU 2000A model but
is due to Chapront et al. (2002) Astron. Astrophys., 387, 700.

@code{BISECT([@var{x},] @var{y}, @var{values} [, AXIS=@var{axis},
POS=@var{pos}, WIDTH=@var{width}])}

Calculates bisector positions in curves interpolated between data points
with coordinates @code{(@var{x},@var{y})}, along the indicated
@code{@var{axis}} (which, if specified, must be a single scalar) at the
indicated @code{@var{values}}.  The @code{@var{x}} coordinates must be
in ascending order, with one value for each value of @code{@var{y}}
along the indicated @code{@var{axis}}.  Interpolation is done with
natural cubic splines.  Here, a bisector is a curve that lies
horizontally midway between two branches straddling a local minimum of a
curve.

If @code{@var{axis}} is not specified, then the @code{@var{data}} is
treated as if it is a one-dimensional array.

If @code{@var{pos}} is specified, then it must have a single element,
which indicates at what coordinate along the indicated @code{@var{axis}}
the search for the bisectors must begin.  This is useful if a horizontal
line at the desired level intersects a curve from
@code{(@var{x},@var{y})} in more than two places, which means that there
are at least two bisectors: By specifying @code{@var{pos}} you can
select which bisector to look for.  If no @code{@var{pos}} is specified,
then the search for the bisector is started at the location of the
absolute minimum.

If @code{@var{width}} is specified, then the profile widths (the
distance between the two branches) corresponding to the bisector level
are returned in it.

NOTE: Bisectors are only sought @emph{between} the data values: no
bisectors are found before the first or after the last element of each
treated profile.  If no bisector is found at the sought level, then
@minus{}1 is returned for the bisector position and 0 for the bisector
width.

@code{CALCULATOR}

Enters calculator mode.  In calculator mode, LUX acts like a regular
calculator: it has a current numerical scalar or array, or string value,
(stored in variable @code{$}) which is modified by calculator
commands, and which value is displayed after each command has been
completed.  Calculator mode can only be entered from the main execution
level (i.e., not from within a function or subroutine), and no
statements other than assignments and @code{RETURN} can be executed.

Each newline ends a command.  The result of each command replaces the
current value.  The following commands are supported: a numerical value;
a LUX expression; a binary operator followed by an expression (the
current value is taken for the first operand); the name of a
single-argument function (the current value is taken for the operand);
an equal sign followed by an expression; or the @code{RETURN} command,
which exits calculator mode.

Not all LUX expressions are supported.  If the command is a single name,
then it is taken to be the name of a single-argument function rather
than the name of a variable (forming an expression).  If you wish to
assign the value of a variable to the current value, then prepend an
equal sign.  If you wish to evaluate a multi-argument function, then use
@code{$} if you want the current value for one or more of its arguments.

@code{/TOMAYAN} implies @code{/TOTEXT}. 
@item /...LONGCOUNT

0.0.0.0.0 corresponds to 6 September -3113 in the Julian calendar.
@code{/TOLONGCOUNT} implies @code{/TOTEXT}.  @code{/FROMLONGCOUNT}
only works if the input is text.
@item /...EGYPTIAN
indicates the Egyptian calendar used in ancient astronomy (e.g., by
Ptolemy in the Almagest), with strictly 365 days per year.  The year
count is based on the era of Nabonassar (1 Thoth, year 1 = 26 February
@minus{}746 in the Julian calendar).
@item /...LUNAR
indicates a (fractional) count of New Moons since the first New Moon
after Julian Day number 0.  The count is based on the mean motion of the
Moon, disregarding short-term perturbations.
@item /TOLATIN
indicates the Common calendar counted the Latin way.
@item /TOTEXT
indicates that the dates are returned in text form, as strings, with the
(integer) day, month, and year separated by whitespace.  This keyword
does not work with @code{/TOJD}.
@item /TOISOTEXT
indicates that the dates are returned in text form, as strings, in
standard ISO format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.
@item /...YMD
indicates that the components of each date are in the order year, month,
day.  This keyword does not work with @code{/...JD}. 
@item /...DMY
indicates that the components of each date are in the order day, month,
year.  This keyword does not work with @code{/...JD}.
@item /...UTC
indicates dates/times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
@item /...TAI
indicates dates/times in International Atomic Time (TAI).
@item /...TT
indicates dates/times in Terrestrial Time (TT).
@end table

The default source calendar is @code{/FROMCOMMON} if @code{@var{date}}
is numerical and has 3 elements in its first dimension, or if
@code{@var{date}} contains text data.  Otherwise, the default source
calendar is @code{/FROMJD}.  The default target calendar is @code{/TOJD}
unless the source calendar was @code{/FROMJD}, in which case the default
target calendar is @code{/TOCOMMON}.

With numerical input, one number is expected per date for @code{/FROMJD}
and @code{/FROMLUNAR}, and three numbers for all other calendars.
Three-number input is interpreted by default in the order year, month,
day.  For the Gregorian, Julian, Islamic, and Egyptian calendars (all of
which always have 12 months per calendar year), month and day numbers
outside of the usual ranges may be specified; month numbers are reduced
to the range of 1 - 12, adjusting the year count accordingly, and day
numbers are interpreted relative to the start of the indicated month
just like day numbers within the expected ranges.  For example, the
input [232,17,43] is adjusted internally to [233,5,43], which indicates
a date 42 days after the one indicated by [233,5,1], and [232,-5,-3]
indicates a date 4 days before [231,7,1].  For most calendars, negative
and zero years may be specified.

If the input is in the form of text and @code{/FROMLONGCOUNT} is not
specified, then each string must contain a date with the day and year
written as optionally signed numbers, and the month name in characters
(not starting with a digit or a + or -).  By default, the first
encountered number is taken to be the day, and the second number the
year.  If the date string is incomplete, then a year, month, or day
number of 1 is assumed for the missing parts.  If a single number is
specified in the text string, then it is taken to be the year number.
If an input calendar is specified, then the specified month name is
compared only to the month names associated with that calendar;
otherwise, it is compared to the month names of all calendars and the
first match is accepted.  The number of month name characters that is
compared is the minimum number that is required to distinguish between
the months in the calendar: 3 for the Gregorian and Julian calendars,
4 for the Egyptian calendar, 9 for the Islamic calendar.  Case is
unimportant.

For @code{/FROMLONGCOUNT}, the text input is searched for sequences of
digits separated by one or more non-digit characters.  Each sequence
of digits is interpreted as a decimal number that indicates the number
of units of time at each level of the Long Count, from large to small.
There may be any (non-zero) number of levels.  Each next higher level
is assumed to represent a unit of time 20 times greater than the next
lower level, except that the 3rd level is only 18 times greater than
the 2nd one.  The lowest level represents days. 

The default time system is @code{/...UTC}.  Transformation from UTC to
TAI or TT is based on tables of leap seconds for dates between
1961-01-01 and (predicted) 1999-07-01, and on estimates for UT since
-390 for dates before 1961-01-01.  (See "Explanatory Supplement to the
Astronomical Almanac", P. K. Seidelmann (editor), University Science
Books (1992), section 2.553).

Not all calendars have a new day start at the same time.  For example,
in the Common calendar a new day starts at midnight, but in the Islamic
and Hebrew calendars a new day starts at sunset.  Our calendar
conversion algorithms must deal with this somehow.  For the traditional
calendars (all except @code{/...JD} and @code{/...LUNAR}), the
conversions are based on the integer parts of the dates only, and are
referred to noontime.  The fractional part of the day is not modified.
For example, day 1 Muharram 1 A.H. (@ref{Islamic Calendar}) ran from
sunset on 15 July 622 C.E. (@ref{Common Calendar}) to sunset on 16 July,
so 1 Muharram 1 A.H. coincided with parts of 15 and 16 July 622 C.E.,
and 16 July 622 C.E. coincided with parts of 1 and 2 Muharram 1 A.H.
The @code{CALENDAR} function gives you the correspondence between these
calendars at noon.  It shows that noon of 1 Muharram 1 A.H. coincided
with noon of 16 July 622 C.E.

@subsubsection General Calendar Details

Most calendars are intended to follow some celestial cycle, such as the
phases of the moon or the seasons.  These cycles usually don't consist
of a nice, integral number of days or months, so sometimes complicated
rules for varying the length of years and months must be used to keep
them in alignment with the target cycle.

The @emph{epoch} of a calendar is its adopted starting point: the start
of year 1 (or day 1) of the calendar.  This is not necessarily the same
as the day when the calendar was first used.  For example, the currently
used epoch for the Julian and Common calendars was invented about 500
years after the time indicated by that epoch.

An @emph{era} is the period of time after an @emph{epoch}, and so is
connected to a particular calendar.  To fully specify a particular day,
one must specify not just the date corresponding to that day in the
chosen calendar, but also which calendar one uses, for readers who might
not use the same calendar system.  This is done by specifying the era.
For example, the period starting with year 1 of the Common calendar is
the Common Era.  Year 1432 of the Common calendar is referred to as year
1432 of the Common Era, or 1432 C.E.

One needs to be able to refer to years before the epoch of the calendar.
Many calendars were invented in regions and times where the number zero
was not known.  In those regions and times, the year directly preceding
year 1 was referred to as "year 1 before the epoch (or era)", and the
preceding year was "year 2 before the epoch".  We'll refer to this
method of counting years as the "historical method".  However, it is
mathematically more convenient to keep counting down by ones when one
goes to preceding years, so then the years immediately preceding year 1
are years 0 and @minus{}1.  This method is preferred by astronomers, and
we'll refer to it as the "astronomical method".  The @code{CALENDAR}
function uses the astronomical method.

@subsubsection Common Calendar

We refer to the calendar system that is in most widespread international
use around the world today as the Common Calendar.  The Common Calendar
consists of two parts: it uses the rules of the @ref{Julian Calendar}
for dates up to 4 October 1582, and the rules of the @ref{Gregorian
Calendar} for dates starting with 15 October 1582.  In the Common
Calendar, 15 October 1582 was the day immediately following 4 October
1582.  The era of this calendar is referred to as the Common Era (C.E.).

@node Julian Calendar, Gregorian Calendar, Common Calendar, CALENDAR
@subsubsection Julian Calendar

The Julian Calendar is a solar calendar that was introduced in the Roman
Empire, in the year now referred to (in the @ref{Common Calendar}) as
@minus{}44, during the reign of Julius Caesar, for whom it and its fifth
month are named.  The calendar was slightly reformed by emperor August,
for whom the sixth month is named.  After this reform, which was
complete by the year now referred to as year 8 C.E., this calendar was
used continuously in many regions of Europe until 1582 C.E., though
there was variation (over both time and region) in such things as the
used epoch, the used day count within each month, and which day was the
first day of the year.  The following description reflects the modern
choices for these things.

In this calendar, each year consists of 12 months with between 28 and 31
days per month, with new days starting at midnight.  Each new day starts
at midnight.  The English names of these months and their lengths are
listed in the following table.

@example
Number  Month Name  Length
  1        January    31
  2       February    28 (29 in a leap year)
  3          March    31
  4          April    30
  5            May    31
  6           June    30
  7           July    31
  8         August    31
  9      September    30
 10        October    31
 11       November    30
 12       December    31
@end example

In this calendar, years have either 365 or 366 days.  The longer years,
called @emph{leap years}, occur every fourth year, whenever the year
count is evenly divisible by 4.  For example, the years 1000 and 1004
were leap years.  The extra day is inserted at the end of the month of
February, as the 29th day of February.  January 1 is now the beginning
of the new year, though this was not always the case.

Many different epochs have been used in conjunction with this calendar,
for example, the assumed year of the foundation of the city of Rome
(@minus{}753 C.E., referred to as year 1 A.U.C. -- ab urbe condita), or
the beginning of the reign of emperor Diocletian (284 C.E.), or the
approximate birth year of the Messiah of the Christian faith (1 C.E. = 1
A.D. -- anno Domini)

For dating historical events, use of the final rules of the Julian
calendar (with the Common Era) is extended into the past.  This
anachronistic calendar is referred to as the Julian Proleptic Calendar,
or, if confusion is unlikely, as the Julian Calendar.

@c -------------------------------------
@node Gregorian Calendar, Islamic Calendar, Julian Calendar, CALENDAR
@subsubsection Gregorian Calendar

The Gregorian Calendar was introduced in the Catholic parts of Europe in
1582 C.E. by Pope Gregory XIII (then the religious leader of the Roman
Catholic faith) as an improvement upon the @ref{Julian Calendar} to keep
the average length of the calendar year better in line with the seasons.

The rules, months, and days of the Gregorian calendar are the same as
those of the Julian Calendar, except for the leap year rules.  In the
Gregorian calendar, a year is a leap year if the year number is evenly
divisible by 4, but not if the year number is evenly divisible by 100,
and this last exception must not be applied if the year number is evenly
divisible by 400.  For example, 1600 and 2000 are leap years, but 1700,
1800, and 1900 are not.

For the other details, see @ref{Julian Calendar}.

@node Islamic Calendar, Hebrew Calendar, Gregorian Calendar, CALENDAR
@subsubsection Islamic Calendar

The Islamic calendar is a strict lunar calendar.  The beginning of a new
month is tied to the first sighting of the lunar crescent in the evening
after a New Moon.  Because the beginning of the month is determined by
observation, it cannot be accurately predicted.  However, for secular
use a tabular calendar is available that is determined by fixed rules.
This tabular calendar is described below.

The Islamic tabular calendar has 12 months per year, that each have 29
or 30 days, starting at sunset.  The month names and lengths in days are
listed in the following table.

@example
Number  Month Name   Length
  1       Muharram     30
  2          Safar     29
  3       Rabi`a I     30
  4      Rabi`a II     29
  5       Jumada I     30
  6      Jumada II     29
  7          Rajab     30
  8        Sha`ban     29
  9        Ramadan     30
 10        Shawwal     29
 11  Dhu al-Q`adah     30
 12  Dhu al-Hijjah     29 (30 in a leap year)
@end example  

There are 11 leap years in a fixed cycle of 30 years.  In a leap year,
the extra day is added at the end of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah.  The
epoch of the calendar is sunset of 15 July 622 C.E. and "year of the Era
of the Hegira" may be abbreviated to A.H. (= Anno Hegirae).  The epoch
coincides with the migration of the Prophet Mohammed from Mecca to
Medina.  The @code{CALENDAR} function takes an A.H. date to refer to the
date that is current at noontime.  The first noon after the epoch was
the noon of 16 July 622 C.E., so the @code{CALENDAR} function equates 1
Muharram 1 A.H. with 16 July 622 C.E.

@c -------------------------------------
@node Hebrew Calendar, Julian Day Numbers, Islamic Calendar, CALENDAR
@subsubsection Hebrew Calendar

The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar.  Its current rules were
pronounced in the 4th century C.E. by Patriarch Hillel II.  New days
start at sunset, new months start at a New Moon, and new years start in
the northern hemisphere spring.

A Hebrew calendar year has 12 or 13 months, that each have 29 or 30
days.  The month names and lengths in days are listed in the following
table.  Biblical tradition lists Nisan as the first month but has the
new year start on the first day of Tishri.  The @code{CALENDAR} function
counts months from the start of the year in Tishri.  The month numbers,
names, and lengths (in days) are listed in the following table

@example
Number  Month Name    Length
  1          Nisan      30
  2          Iyyar      29
  3          Sivan      30
  4         Tammuz      29
  5             Av      30
  6           Elul      29
  7         Tishri      30
  8        Heshvan   29 or 30
  9         Kislev   29 or 30
 10          Tevet      29
 11         Shevat      30
 12         Adar Ⅰ      30 (only present in leap years)
12/13     Adar (Ⅱ)      29
@end example

Leap days may be inserted at the ends of the months of Heshvan and
Kislev, and a leap month Adar Ⅰ may be inserted just before month
Adar, which in that case is renamed to Adar Ⅱ.  This means that any
given year may contain six different numbers of days, as listed in the
following table

@example
  Days     Designation
   353     deficient ordinary year
   354     regular ordinary year
   355     complete ordinary year
   383     deficient leap year
   384     regular leap year
   385     complete leap year
@end example

There are 7 leap years in a fixed cycle of 19 years.

The epoch of the Hebrew calendar is sunset of 6 October @minus{}3760
C.E., which was taken to be the date of the creation of the world.  The
Era of the Hebrew calendar is referred to as A.M. (= Anno Mundi).  The
first noon after the epoch was the noon of 7 October @minus{}3760 C.E.,
so the @code{CALENDAR} function equates 1 Tishri 1 A.M. with 7 October
@minus{}3760 C.E.

For transforming from Hebrew calendar dates, years from -5879540
through 5878588 provide accurate results.

@node Julian Day Numbers, Egyptian Calendar, Hebrew Calendar, CALENDAR
@subsubsection Julian Day Number

Julian Day Numbers were introduced by astronomers in the 19th century
C.E. as a continuous day numbering scheme without years or leap days.
The epoch (the start of day 0) is 1 January @minus{}4712 C.E. at
12:00:00 TT (by recommendation of the International Astronomical Union).
For precise astronomical calculation, fractional Julian day numbers are
used.  The @code{CALENDAR} function returns fractional Julian day
numbers, assuming that the fractional part of the day specification in
the source calendar is measured since the midnight before the noon
corresponding to that date.  This means that an integer date in the
source calendar corresponds to a JD (= Julian Date) ending in ".5".  To
get the integer count, round to the nearest integer; round JDs ending in
".5" up to the next greater integer.

Astronomical Union, see at

@node Egyptian Calendar, Mayan Tikal Calendar, Julian Day Numbers, CALENDAR
@subsubsection Egyptian Calendar

Ancient Egyptians used a calendar that had 365 days in a year, without
exceptions.  The year was divided into 12 months of 30 days each, plus 5
extra days (referred to by the ancient Greeks as the epagomenai) after
the last month.  Because of its great regularity, this calendar was used
by ancient Greek and European astronomers until only a few centuries
ago.

The names and lengths of the months of the Egyptian calendar are listed
in the following table.

@example
 Number      Name  Length
   1        Thoth    30
   2      Phaophi    30
   3        Athyr    30
   4       Choiak    30
   5         Tybi    30
   6      Mecheir    30
   7    Phamenoth    30
   8    Pharmuthi    30
   9       Pachon    30
  10        Payni    30
  11       Epiphi    30
  12       Mesore    30
       epagomenai     5
@end example

The @code{CALENDAR} function regards the epagomenai as a 13th month.
The era used for this calendar by the @code{CALENDAR} function is the
Era of Nabonassar, used by Ptolemy, with epoch 26 February @minus{}746
C.E.  Other eras that have been used elsewhere are the Era of Philippos
(which marks the death of Alexander the Great) starting in year 425 of
Nabonassar, the Era of emperor Hadrian of Rome, starting in year 864 of
Nabonassar, and the Era of emperor Antoninus of Rome, starting in year
885 of Nabonassar.

@node Mayan Tikal Calendar, Mayan Long Count, Egyptian Calendar, CALENDAR
@subsubsection Mayan Tikal Calendar

The peoples of Central America used a great number of calendar systems,
but they all followed the same overall pattern.  The calendar described
here is the Mayan "Tikal" calendar.

The Tikal calendar used a cycle of 20 days with a name for each day in
the cycle, and a cycle of 13 days with a cardinal number for each day
in the cycle (starting with 1).  These two cycles were counted
concurrently, so that after day "6 Ik'" followed day "7 Ak'b'al" and
then "8 K'an".  A particular combination recurred after 260 days,
which period was called the "Tzolk'in" in the Yucatecan language.  The
names of the days in the 20-day cycle were as follows: Imix', Ik',
Ak'b'al, K'an, Chikchan, Kimi, Manik', Lamat, Muluk, Ok, Chuwen, Eb',
B'en, Ix, Men, Kib', Kab'an, Etz'nab', Kawak, Ajaw.

There was also a year count, called @emph{Haab'}, with a year of 365
days divided into 18 months of 20 days each and a 19th month with 5
days only.  The months had names, and the days had numbers, and these
were counted as we are used to today, so after day "1 Pop" followed
day "2 Pop" and so on.  However, the numbers started at 0 instead of
1.  The Mayan names of the months were: Pop, Wo, Sip, Sotz', Sek, Xul,
Yaxk'in, Mol, Ch'en, Yax, Sac, Keh, Mak, K'ank'in, Muwan, Pax,
K'ayab', Kumk'u, Wayeb'.  There were no leap years in the central
American calendars, so the year count ran out of step with the seasons
by about one day every four years.

A particular date was usually identified by its position in both the
tzol kin and the haab, for instance as "6 Ik' 2 Pop", and for the next
day "7 Ak'b'al 3 Pop". After 52 years (of 365 days) the same
tzol-kin/year-count designation would return. This period is often
referred to as a "calendar round" or a "Mayan century".

In many cases, Mayan monuments display dates in only the calendar-round
manner, which means that these dates return every 52 years (of 365
days). This means that we can pinpoint those dates in the modern
calendar only up to a multiple of 52 years.

The Spanish conquistadores who conquered Central America in the 16th
century ordered the destruction of much of the Mayan written records,
and the precise correlation between the Mayan calendars and modern
calendars is therefore not exactly known.

The @code{CALENDAR} function can return, in text form, the Tikal
designation (Tzolk'in -- Haab') for any date in the modern calendars,
based on the most widely accepted correlation between the Mayan and
modern calendars.

@subsubsection Mayan Long Count

The Mayan Long Count is a calendar consisting of 5 cycles that indicate
the number of days since the last beginning of the full cycle.  The
name, definition, and length of each cycle is indicated in the
following table.

@example
  Name       Definition            Length
   k'in      = 1 day                1 day
 winal       = 20 k'in             20 days
   tun       = 18 winal           360 days
 k'atun      = 20 tun           7,200 days = about 20 years
b'ak'tun     = 20 k'atun      144,000 days = about 394 years
(full cycle) = 20 b'ak'tun  2,880,000 days = about 7885 years
@end example

A particular date in the Long Count is written as a set of five
numbers, one for each subcycle, separated by periods (@kbd{.}).  For
example, the date 1.2.3.4.5 means 1 b'ak'tun, 2 k'atun, 3 tun, 4
winal, 5 k'in after the beginning of the full cycle.  The beginning of
the last cycle, at long count 0.0.0.0.0, is thought to correspond to 6
September @minus{}3113 C.E.

The Long Count 13.0.0.0.0 corresponds to 21 December 2012 C.E., and the
current full cycle will be complete on 13 October 4772 C.E.  The
@code{CALENDAR} function can return, in text form, the Long Count
corresponding to any date.

@subsubsection Latin Calendar

The ancient Romans started the Julian calendar which eventually evolved
into the Common calendar.  However, the method of the Romans for
designating dates in their calendar was quite different from ours.  We
refer to the Common calendar with the Roman way of designating dates (in
the Latin language) as the "Latin Calendar".

The Romans did not know Arabic numerals.  They wrote numbers using
letters, according to the following table.

@example
  Letter    Numeric Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X            10
    L            50
    C           100
    D           500
    M          1000
@end example

If a "smaller" letter (i.e., earlier in the table) follows a "bigger"
one (i.e., later in the table), then the values add up, but if a smaller
letter precedes a bigger one, then its value must be subtracted from the
total.  For example, @code{DCX} stands for 500 + 100 + 10 = 610, but
@code{CDX} stands for 500 @minus{} 100 + 10 = 410.

The Latin names for the months are listed in the following table.  They
are similar to the English month names, which are derived from them.  In
the Latin language, the way to write a word -- and especially the last
part of a word -- depends on the context.  The table lists three forms
that are useful in the calendar.

@example
Number            Latin Month Names              English Month Name
  1     Ianuarius    Ianuariis      Ianuarias        January
  2     Februarius   Februariis     Februarias       February
  3     Martius      Martiis        Martias          March
  4     Aprilis      Aprilibus      Apriles          April
  5     Maius        Maiis          Maias            May
  6     Iunius       Iuniis         Iunias           June
  7     Iulius       Iuliis         Iulias           July
  8     Augustus     Augustis       Augustas         August
  9     September    Septembribus   Septembres       September
 10     October      Octobribus     Octobres         October
 11     November     Novembribus    Novembres        November
 12     December     Decembribus    Decembres        December
@end example

A month as a whole was referred to with the first of the three listed
Latin names.  For example, the month of January was @emph{mensis
Ianuarius}. 

Three days in each month had names: the @emph{Kalends} (hence calendar),
the @emph{Nones}, and the @emph{Idus} (as in "Beware the Ides of
March").  The Kalends was the first name of a month.  The Idus was the
13th day in most months, but the 15th day in March, May, July, and
October.  The Nones was 8 days before the Idus, so it was the 5th or 7th
day of the month.  These days were referred to using month names from
the second column of the table; for example Kalendae Ianuariis, Nonae
Februariis, Idibus Martiis.  The day preceding one of these days was
referred to using month names from the third column of the table, after
the word @emph{Pridie}; for example, Pridie Kalendas Apriles, Pridie
Nonae Maias, Pridie Idus Iunias.

The Romans indicated other days of the month by counting
@emph{backwards} from the next later Kalends, Nones, or Idus.  This
means that days in the second half of every month (after the Idus) would
be referred to as "so many days before the Kalends of the next month".
In addition, the Romans counted @emph{inclusive}.  In figuring out the
difference between two numbers, they'd count both the first and the last
numbers.  For example, to get from today to tomorrow, the Romans would
count two days rather than just one.  So, the 30th day of June, which is
the day before the Kalends (first day) of July, would be referred to as
Pridie Kalendas Iulias, and the day before that (the 29th of June) as
Ante Diem III Kalendas Iulias.  The "ante diem" means something like
"the earlier day".

The Romans used to count years from the (mythical) year of the founding
of the city of Rome in year @minus{}751 of the Common Era.  They
referred to a year count in the era as Ab Urbe Condita ("since the
founding of the City"), abbreviated to A.U.C.  However, our Latin
calendar uses the same era as the Common calendar.  The year number is
introduced by the word "Anno" (year).  As an example of a complete date,
the 15th of December of 1965 is referred to as "Ante Diem XVIII Kalendas
Ianuarias Anno MCMLXVI", which translates loosely as "The 18th inclusive
day before the Kalends of January of the year 1966".

The Romans did not know of the number zero or of negative numbers.  Such
year numbers are printed in the Latin calendar using the usual Arabic
numerals.  In addition, numbers greater than or equal to 4000 are also
printed using Arabic numerals.

@node Time Scales,  , Latin Calendar, CALENDAR
@subsubsection Time Scales

Various time scales are in use.  International Atomic Time (TAI) is a
uniform time scale with a unit of one SI second.  It was implemented
around 1960.  Each TAI minute is 60 SI seconds, each TAI hour equals 60
TAI minutes, and each TAI day equals 24 TAI hours.  Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) is the basis of most administrative times on Earth.
Its units are the SI second, the minute, the hour, and the day, and it
differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds.  By infrequent and
irregular insertion of leap seconds, the UTC day start is tied to the
Earth's rotation.  The length of specific UTC minutes, hours, and days
may therefore differ from TAI minutes, hours, and days.  Universal Time
(UT, UT1) is a non-uniform time scale tied to the Earth's rotation.  It
has no leap seconds, so the length of its unit (the UT second) depends
on the Earth's rotation.  UT differs from UTC by less than 0.9 seconds
through the judicious insertion of leap seconds in UTC.  Terrestrial
Dynamical Time (TDT) -- or Terrestrial Time (TT) for short -- was
implemented in 1984 as the dynamical time scale for geocetric phenomena.
Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) was implemented in 1984 as the
dynamical time scale for solar-system barycentric phenomena.  The
difference between TDT and TDB is always less than 0.002 seconds.  The
difference between TDT and TAI is fixed at about 32 seconds.  Before
1984, Ephemeris Time (ET) was used as a uniform time scale for
ephemerides, instead of TDT and TDB.

coordinate system determined by the specified keyword.  By default, the
coordinates are taken to be in pixels (@code{DEV}) when they are larger
than 1, or in device-independent coordinates (@code{DVI}) when they are
smaller than 1.  They default to @code{!XC}, @code{!YC} (see
below). 
@item size
The relative size of the characters.  Defaults to @code{!FSIZE}, which
defaults to @code{1}.
@item theta
The angle in degrees with respect to the positive x axis along which the
text is plotted.  Defaults to @code{0}.
@item font
The number of the font in which the plotting is started.  Defaults to
@code{!FONT} which defaults to @code{6}.
@item flag
A flag that indicates if the pen is down (when @code{@var{flag}}
nonzero) or up (when @code{@var{flag}} is zero).  If the pen is up then
nothing is plotted, though the pen position variables @code{!XC}
and @code{!YC} are updated (see below).
@end table

A number of TeX-style commands are supported, including:
@table @asis
@item Greek lower-case letters:
@code{`alpha `beta `chi `delta `epsilon `eta `gamma `iota `kappa `lambda
`mu `nu `omega `omicron `phi `psi `rho `sigma `tau `theta `upsilon `xi
`zeta}.
@item Greek upper-case letters:
(all of them, even those that are equal to certain Roman letters and
therefore not separately available in TeX): @code{`Alpha `Beta `Chi
`Delta `Epsilon `Eta `Gamma `Iota `Kappa `Lambda `Mu `Nu `Omega `Omicron
`Phi `Psi `Rho `Sigma `Tau `Theta `Upsilon `Xi `Zeta}.
@item Font & size selection:
@code{`bf} for a bold roman font (font 5), @code{`it} for a bold italic
font (font 8), @code{`rm} for a roman font (font 6), and @code{`sf}
for a roman sans serif font (font 1).  @code{`size} (non-TeX) introduces
a new font size (measured by an integer or floating-point number
relative to the entry font).  According to the usual TeX standards, the
following argument must be enclosed in curly braces @code{@{@}} if it
has more than a single digit.
@item Various mathematical symbols:
@code{`cap}: the set union symbol; @code{`cup}: the set intersection
symbol; @code{`exists}: the existence indicator; @code{`ge}: the "greater
than or equal" symbol; @code{`in}: the is-element-of symbol;
@code{`int}: the integration sign; @code{`le}: the "less than or equal
to" symbol; @code{`nabla}: the nabla symbol; @code{`oint}: the closed
integration sign; @code{`partial}: the partial differentiation symbol;
@code{`perp}: the perpendicular sign; @code{`pm}: the plus-minus sign;
@code{`propto}: the proportional-to sign; @code{`sim}: the similar-to
symbol; @code{`subset}: the is-subset-of symbol; @code{`supset}: the
is-superset-of symbol; @code{`surd}: the square-root symbol;
@code{`times}: the multiplication symbol.
@item Arrows:
@code{`downarrow}; @code{`leftarrow}; @code{`rightarrow}; @code{`uparrow}.
@item Miscellaneous symbols:
@code{`box}: (non-TeX) a box; @code{`clubsuit}: the clubs card suit
symbol; @code{`dag}: the dagger symbol; @code{`ddag}: the double dagger
symbol; @code{`diamondsuit}: the diamonds card suit symbol;
@code{`heartsuit}: the hearts card suit symbol; @code{`odot}: the
astronomical Sun symbol (a dot in a circle); @code{`spadesuit}: the
spade card suit symbol. 
@end table

In addition, TeX math-mode superscripting (introduced by @kbd{^}),
subscripting (introduced by @kbd{_}) and brace-enclosed grouping
(@code{@{@}}) to indicate the scope of super- or subscripts are
supported.  Grouping to delimit the influence of font or size changes is
not supported!  In this routine, there is no separate TeX-style "math
mode": all of these TeX-style commands are available all the time.

For example, the following two strings yield an alpha with 2 sigma for
superscript, followed by the "is-a-member-of" sign, followed by an italic
Q: @code{'$7a$E$X2$7r$N$9e$8Q'} using the short notation, and
@code{'`alpha^@{2`sigma@}`in`it@{Q@}'} using TeX-style notation.

The coordinate system for @code{@var{x}} and @code{@var{y}} is chosen as
described at @ref{Screen Coordinates}.

The following system variable influence or are influenced by calls to
@code{CALLIG}:

@table @code
@item !XC, !YC
After the call, @code{!XC} and @code{!YC} contain the
coordinates of the point just after the last drawn character.
@item !CRATIO
The characters are drawn in device-independent coordinates, which means
they will look squashed if the display is not square.  You may tweak
this using @code{!CRATIO}, an extra scaling factor for the
characters' y size.
@item !FSIZE
The relative size of the characters, if @code{@var{size}} is not specified.
@item !FONT
The entry font of the characters, if @code{@var{font}} is not specified.

MAXIT=@var{maxit}, RMS=@var{rms}, SECOND=@var{second}, /UPDATE,
/ITERATE, /VOCAL, /QUICK, /RECORD, /ORDERED]}

This routine divides vectors into clusters, based on their proximity to
cluster centers.  @code{@var{data}}, @code{@var{centers}},
@code{@var{index}}, @code{@var{sample}}, @code{@var{phantom}}, and
@code{@var{maxit}} are input variables; @code{@var{centers}},
@code{@var{index}}, @code{@var{size}}, @code{@var{rms}}, and
@code{@var{second}} are output variables and must therefore be named
variables.  The arguments are:

@table @var
@item data
The data points.  The first dimensions of @code{@var{data}} selects the
components of the vectors; i.e. the first vector is
@code{@var{data}(*,0)} if @code{@var{data}} has two dimensions.  Each data
point is assigned to the cluster whose center is closest of all cluster
centers to the data point at that time.
@item centers
The cluster centers.  If @code{@var{centers}} is a scalar on entry, then it
denotes the number of clusters to divide the data into, and a random
sample (of appropriate size) of the data vectors is taken as initial
guess for the cluster center positions.  If @code{@var{centers}} is an array on
input, then each @code{@var{centers}(*,k@dots{})} is taken to contain the
(initial) position of a cluster center.  The final (possibly updated)
cluster centers are returned in @code{@var{centers}} on exit.
@item index
The cluster assignment of the data points.  If @code{@var{index}} is an array
of appropriate size on entry, and if @code{@var{phantom}} is not specified, then
the elements of @code{@var{index}} denote the initial cluster membership of the
datapoints.  On exit, @code{@var{index}} contains the cluster numbers that the
data points have been assigned to.  No or an undefined @code{@var{index}}
implies @code{/PHANTOM}.
@item size
The cluster sizes.  If @code{@var{size}} is specified, then the number of
elements in each cluster is returned in it upon exit from the routine.
@item sample
The data point sample size.  If @code{@var{sample}} is an integer larger than
one, then it indicates the size of a random sample of data points that
should be treated.  If @code{@var{sample}} equals 1, then a sample ten times
bigger than the number of clusters is used.  If @code{@var{sample}} is not
specified or falls outside the range mentioned before, then all data
points are treated.
@item phantom
If @code{@var{phantom}} is specified, then it indicates that the
clusters should be pre-stocked with phantom members, to partially
suppress movement of the cluster centers during clustering.  The value
assigned to @code{@var{phantom}}, if an integer larger than 1, indicates
how many phantom members to assign to each cluster prior to treatment of
the data points.  If @code{@var{phantom}} is not specified, and
@code{@var{index}} is an array of appropriate size, then the clusters
contain the members indicated by @code{@var{index}} prior to clustering.
If @code{@var{phantom}} equals 1, then 10 phantom members are assigned
to each cluster prior to clustering.  Any phantom members are removed
after clustering, before exiting the routine.
@item maxit
@code{@var{maxit}} specifies the maximum number of iterations that is
allowed for this call to @code{CLUSTER}.  If @code{@var{maxit}} is not
specified, then the number of iterations is unlimited.
@item rms
If @code{@var{rms}} is specified then the average root-mean-square
distance of the members of each cluster to its center is returned in it.
@end table

The keywords are:
@table @code
@item /UPDATE
signals that the cluster center positions must be updated during the
clustering, so that each cluster center at any time during the
clustering equals the average position of all members in the cluster at
that time (including any phantom members).  If @code{/UPDATE} is not
specified, then the cluster centers do not move during clustering.
@item /ITERATE
specifies that updating must be iterated until the cluster centers are
stable and upon exit all data points are members of the cluster whose
center is the closest one of all cluster centers.  @code{/ITERATE}
implies @code{/UPDATE}.
@item /VOCAL
specifies that the number of reclustered data points (and the number of
changed clusters, if @code{/ITERATE} is also specified) are printed.
@item /QUICK
specifies that only data points in clusters that were changed during the
last iteration or so far during the current one should be treated during
the current iteration.  The other data points are left unchanged.  This
keyword implies @code{/ITERATE} and @code{/UPDATE}.
@item /ORDER
specifies that there is some degree of order in @code{@var{data}}, so
that there is more than a random chance that the current data point and
the previous data point belong in the same cluster.  The time penalty of
this option is small, so it is selected by default.  Specify
@code{/NOORDER} to deselect it.  This option only affects the first
iteration.
@item /RECORD
specifies that the cluster positions and sizes should be written to file
@file{cluster.out} after each iteration.  This option has effect only if
@code{/ITERATE} was also selected.
@end table

@code{CLUSTER,data,c,i} with undefined @code{i} yields cluster centers
which are not distrubuted evenly.  @code{CLUSTER,data,c,i,/ITERATE}
yields a more even distribution.  For large data sets it is advised to
first use @code{CLUSTER,data,c,i,/SAMPLE,/ITERATE} (or with
@code{SAMPLE=sample_size}) to get fairly evenly distributed cluster
centers, and then @code{CLUSTER,data,c,i} to assign all data points to
the clusters.

When random samples of data points are treated, then the current
clustering algorithm is known as the Continous k-Means Algorithm.

@subsection COMPRESS
@findex COMPRESS

@code{COMPRESS(@var{data} [, @var{dimensions}], @var{factors})} 

Returns a compressed copy of array @code{@var{data}}, which may have an
arbitrary number of dimensions.  The positive integer compression
factors are taken from @code{@var{factors}} and the dimensions that
these factors are applied to are taken from @code{@var{dimensions}},
which defaults to @code{INDGEN(@var{factors})}.  If @code{@var{factors}}
contains a single number and @code{@var{dimensions}} is not specified,
then the compression factor is applied to all dimensions.

The result is of the same data type as @code{@var{data}}.  Each element
of the result contains the average of a fixed number of neighboring
elements of @code{@var{data}} indicated by @code{@var{fctors}} and
@code{@var{dimensions}}.  Of each dimension of @code{@var{data}}, the
first part is treated that has a size equal to the greatest multiple of
the compression factor for that dimension that fits the dimension of
@code{@var{data}}.  For example, if @code{@var{data}} is an array of 11
by 7 elements and @code{@var{factors}} contains the numbers 4 and 2,
then the result will have dimensions 2 (= @code{FIX(11/4)}) by 3 (=
@code{FIX(7/2)}), and the part of @code{@var{data}} that is treated is
indicated by the range @code{(0:7,0:5)}.  The first element of the
result will be equal to the average of @code{@var{data}(0:3,0:1)}.

Note: The invocation of this version of @code{COMPRESS} is not
backwardly compatible with the old one, which treated two-dimensional
data only.  The old version was called like this: @code{COMPRESS (
@var{data}, @var{xfac} [, @var{yfac}])} where @code{@var{xfac}} and
@code{@var{yfac}} were the compression factors for the first and second
dimensions, respectively, and @code{@var{yfac}} defaulted to

Tries to compress @code{@var{array}} and writes the result in array
@code{@var{out}}, which must be predefined and large enough to contain
the result.  @code{@var{byte_slice}} specifies how many bits per number
are passed to @code{@var{out}} without compression.  If
@code{@var{byte_slice}} is too small or too large, then less efficient
compression or even expansion may occur.  Try three less than the
array's entropy for @code{@var{byte_slice}}.

Presently, only compression of @code{BYTE}, @code{WORD}, and (on some
platforms) @code{LONG} arrays is supported.  Associated system variables
are:

@table @code
@item !CRUNCH_SLICE
the last specified @code{@var{byte_slice}}.
@item !CRUNCH_BITS
the number of bits the last compressed array needed.
@item !CRUNCH_BPP
the number of bits per compressed element for the last compressed array.

If @code{@var{out}} has insufficient room to hold the result, then
@code{!CRUNCH_BITS} and @code{!CRUNCH_BPP} are set to 0.  The subroutine
form then also generates an error; the function form does not, but
returns a 0.  If there is sufficient room, then the function form
returns a 1.  If other errors occur (e.g., when @code{@var{array}} is

with no duplicates) at positions @code{@var{xnew}}.  @code{/KEEP}
signals retention of @code{@var{xtab}}, @code{@var{ytab}}, and the
derived second derivatives for use in subsequent interpolations from
the same table.  By default, the interpolated value at the indicated
positions is returned, but if @code{/GETDERIVATIVE} is specified, then
the first derivative at the indicated positions is returned instead.
@code{/PERIODIC} indicates that the data is periodic.  In that case
the first and last @code{@var{ytab}} values must be equal, or else a
discontinuity shows up.

@code{CSPLINE(@var{xtab}, @var{ytab} [, /PERIODIC, /GETDERIVATIVE])}
prepares internal tables for subsequent interpolations with
@code{CSPLINE(@var{xnew} [, /GETDERIVATIVE])}.  The internal table is
retained as if @code{/KEEP} had been specified.

@code{CSPLINE(@var{xnew} [, /GETDERIVATIVE])} interpolates at positions
@code{@var{xnew}} in the retained table, and generates an error if no
table is yet available.  If @code{/GETDERIVATIVE} is specified here but
was not specified when the table was installed, then the extra
auxilliary information is calculated on the fly rather than looked up in
the table: evaluation of the derivative is therefore fastest if
@code{/GETDERIVATIVE} is specified when the table is installed.

@code{CSPLINE()} clears the internal table that was retained.  (In case
the table is real big and you want to get rid of it.)

@code{@var{levels}} contains the data levels to search for.
@code{@var{axis}} (a scalar) contains the axis along which to search
for the data levels, and defaults to 0.

If no locations are found for any of the levels, then scalar @code{-1}
is returned.  Otherwise, a two-dimensional array is returned with its
1st dimension equal to the number of dimensions of @code{@var{y}} and
its 2nd dimension equal to the number of found locations.  If the

the sought data levels (i.e., first the locations for
@code{levels(0)}, then those for @code{levels(1)}, and so on), and
secondarily in order of the coordinates.

If @code{@var{index}} is defined, then it is changed to an integer
array containing the 2nd coordinate of the result where the locations
for each next value from @code{@var{levels}} begin.  If these indices
are stored in @code{i}, then the locations for @code{levels(j)}

Transforms two-dimensional image @code{@var{im}} from Cartesian

@code{FLOAT} or @code{DOUBLE}.  @code{@var{x0}} and @code{@var{y0}}
specify the floating-point Cartesian coordinates of the center of the
polar coordinate system, which defaults to the middle of the image.

The result is another two-dimensional image of the same type as
@code{@var{im}}.  If @code{p = CTOP(im, x0, y0)}, and if @code{(r, a)}
are the coordinates of a pixel in the result image, then the coordinates
of the corresponding pixel in @code{@var{im}} are @code{(x0 +
r*COS(a*#2PI/DIMEN(p,0), y0 + r*SIN(a*#2PI/DIMEN(p,1)))}.  The first
dimension of the result image measures the polar angle, and the second
one the polar radius.  The unit of the radius is one pixel.  The unit of
the azimuth is @code{360/DIMEN(p,1)} degrees.

Results are included for all (integer) values of the radius for which
the corresponding circle falls completely within the image
@code{@var{im}}.  The size of the second dimension of the result is
equal to one more than the radius of the biggest circle (around the
selected center) that falls completely within the image.  The result
image samples @code{@var{im}} at a resolution of approximately one
sample per pixel.  The size of the first dimension is approximately
equal to @code{#2PI*r} if @code{r} is the largest included radius.  The
exact size of the first dimension is chosen such that it has factors
only from the set 2, 3, and 5, so that Fourier transforms with
@code{FFT} in that dimension can be performed relatively quickly.

@subsubsection CTOP Details

The @code{CTOP} function uses bicubic interpolation to find image values
at non-integer Cartesian pixel locations corresponding to sampled polar
coordinates.  For radius @code{r} pixels, the number of samples
(regularly distributed in azimuth) is approximately equal to
@code{#2PI*r}, so that each circle is sampled at a resolution of about 1
px.  The exact number of samples is selected so it has factors from only
the set 2, 3, and 5, for the speediest Fourier transformation.  The
sampled data values are then Fourier-interpolated over the full width of
the return image, so that a particular value of the first dimension
corresponds to the same polar angle for all values of @code{r}.

the value from the original is copied (i.e. reverse of @code{RUNSUM}).
The default @code{@var{order}} is 1.  The @code{/CENTRAL} keyword
indicates that central differencing is performed, i.e. the differences
are put in the middle of the range instead of at the end.  For central
differencing, the border values are always set to zero.

Both @code{@var{axis}} and @code{@var{order}} may contain multiple
elements, in which case a differencing pass is performed for each of the
elements, taken the next available element from both.  If
@code{@var{order}} has only one element but @code{@var{axis}} has more
than one, then the same value of @code{@var{order}} is used during each

@code{DSMOOTH(@var{image}, @var{vx}, @var{vy} [, /BOXCAR, /GAUSSIAN,
/ONESIDED, /TWOSIDED, /TOTAL, /STRAIGHT])}

Returns a directionally smoothed version of @code{@var{image}}.
@code{@var{vx}} and @code{@var{vy}} contain the two coordinates of the
@emph{stream vector} at each point.  The direction of the stream vector
is the direction of the streamline through the point.  For each point, a
weighted average or total is returned of data points on the streamline
through that point, or, if @code{/STRAIGHT} is specified, a weighted
average or total of data points on the straight line which is tangential
to the streamline through that point.  The smoothing width is taken from
the length of the stream vector.

By default, or if @code{/ONESIDED} is selected, then the smoothing
interval extends, for each point, to only one side of that point
(determined by the direction of the stream vector).  If @code{/TWOSIDED}
is selected, then the smoothing interval extends in both directions from
the starting point (determined by the direction of the stream vector and
the exactly opposite direction).

Only the smoothing width at the point for which the weighted average is
determined matters to the result at that point.  By default (or if
@code{/BOXCAR} is specified), the smoothing is of the boxcar type, and
the total length of the boxcar is equal to the length of the stream
vector (if @code{/TWOSIDED} is specified or implied), or to one half of
the length of the stream vector (if @code{/ONESIDED} is specified).  If
@code{/GAUSSIAN} is specified, then the smoothing is gaussian instead,
with the length of the stream vector indicating the FWHM of the gaussian
kernel.

By default, weighted averages are returned.  If @code{/TOTAL} is
specified, then weighted totals are returned instead.

@code{LSMOOTH} is very similar to @code{DSMOOTH}, except that in
@code{LSMOOTH} a particular source value is spread along its associated
streamline (or tangent), whereas in @code{DSMOOTH} a particular target
value is constructed from source values taken from its associated
streamline (or tangent).

observer on the Earth. @code{@var{jdtt}} is the Julian Date in TDB or
TT, @code{@var{ut}} is the Universal Time measured in fractions of a

one is taken to represent the different color channels and the others
are taken to represent positions.  (This is the format returned, for
example, by @code{JPEGREAD}.)

Intensity values are adjusted to make the intensity histogram be
closer to a selected 'ideal curve'.  All color channels of a given
pixel are adjusted by the same factor.  If @code{/SYMMETRIC} is not
specified (or if @code{/NOSYMMETRIC} is specified) then adjustment is
only done for those pixels for which an intensity increase is
indicated.

@code{@var{part}} indicates which part of the adjustment is to be made
and should be a scalar.  It should ordinarily lie between 0
(exclusive) and 1, and defaults to 1, which means to apply the full
adjustment.  0 means to apply no adjustment.

@code{@var{target}} determines the 'ideal curve' to which to adjust.
It indicates the relative intensity of the target median value of all
intensities.  It should ordinarily lie between 0 (black) and 1 (full
brightness), and values near 0.5 are usually the most appropriate.  It
defaults to 100/256.

@code{EQUIVALENCE(@var{e1}, @var{e2})} 

Returns equivalence classes.  In arrays @code{@var{e1}} and
@code{@var{e2}} (which are transformed to type @code{LONG}) the user
specifies which elements of a given set belong to the same equivalence
class: elements @code{@var{e1}(@var{i})} and @code{@var{e2}(@var{i})}
are in the same equivalence class for all @code{@var{i}}.  The result of
this function is an array with the same dimensional structure as
@code{@var{e1}} in which each element contains the lowest element number
in the class that the current element is in.

For example, if @code{e1 = [2,4,6,3]} and @code{e2 = [3,5,7,6]}, then
@code{EQUIVALENCE(e1, e2)} returns @code{[2,4,2,2]}, indicating that
elements 2, 3, 6, and 7 belong to one equivalence class (with element 2
having the smallest element number) and elements 4 and 5 to another
(with element 4 the smallest).

@subsection ESEGMENT
@findex ESEGMENT

@code{ESEGMENT(@var{data} [, SIGN=@var{sign}, DIAGONAL=@var{diagonal},
THRESHOLD=@var{threshold}])}

Extreme-based data segmentation in multiple dimensions.
@code{ESEGMENT(data)} returns the number of directions through each
element of @code{@var{data}} in which the element is a local maximum
compared to its immediate neighbors in each direction.  For example, in
two dimensions we can regard the data as an altitude map, and then this
function checks if the central value exceeds the two adjacent values on
opposite sides of the central value in the N-S direction, the E-W
direction, the NE-SW direction, and the NW-SE direction.  The number of
directions to consider per data element in an @code{n}-dimensional array
is equal to @code{m = (3^n - 1)/2}.

If @code{@var{diagonal}} is specified, then it must be an array with one
element per dimension of @code{@var{data}}.  The elements that are equal
to 0 indicate which dimensions are not checked.  The elements that are
equal to 1 and 2 (after conversion to type @code{LONG}) indicate in
which dimensions checking is performed.  The elements that are equal to
2 indicate in which dimensions checked directions may be diagonal.  All
such directions either have non-zero coordinates only in those
dimensions, or have only a single non-zero coordinate (i.e., a
non-diagnonal direction).  Only approved directions are checked.  For
instance, if @code{@var{diagonal} = [2,2,0]}, then the only checked
directions that have a non-zero third coordinate are those that are
along the 3rd axis.  If @code{@var{diagonal} = [1,1,0]}, then only
directions along the first two axes are checked.  If
@code{@var{diagonal}} contains @code{n1} ones and @code{n2} twos, then
the number of directions per data element in @code{n} dimensions that
will be considered is equal to @code{m = (3^n2 - 1)/2 + n1}.

If @code{@var{sign}} (when converted to type @code{LONG}) is non-zero,
then minima are sought.  If integer @code{@var{sign}} is negative, then
maxima are sought.  By default, a value of @code{+1} is assumed for
@code{@var{sign}}.

Zeros are returned on the 1-px-wide edges of the result, because not
enough data is available there to determine the extremeness in all
directions.

@code{FFT(@var{data} [, @var{axes}, /ALLAXES, /AMPLITUDES])}

@code{FFT, @var{data} [, @var{axes}, /ALLAXES, /AMPLITUDES]}

Returns a discrete forward Fourier transform of the real
@code{@var{data}} along the indicated @code{@var{axes}}
@code{@var{direction}}.  By default, the forward transform (to
frequency space) is applied in the first dimension.  The returned
values are of type @code{DOUBLE}.  The subroutine form replaces
@code{@var{data}} with the transformed version.

If @code{@var{axes}} is specified, then it is taken to contain the
axes along which transformation is to be done.  No axis may appear
more than once.  The axes need not be in any specific order.  If
@code{/ALLAXES} is specified, then all axes are treated.  If neither
@code{@var{axes}} nor @code{/ALLAXES} are specified, then the first
axis is assumed.  The data may have arbitrary positive dimensions.

The returned array has the same dimensions as @code{@var{data}}.

The result are stored as 'half-complex' sequences, in order of
increasing frequency.  For each frequency, first the real and then the
imaginary part is given, except that no imaginary part is given for
values that are always real, i.e., for frequency zero and (for
even-length sequences) also for the highest represented frequency
(equal to half of the sequence length).  The Fourier transform (of
real data) at a negative frequency is the complex conjugate of the
Fourier transform at the corresponding positive frequency, and the
Fourier transform at frequency @code{@var{f}} is equal to that at
frequency @code{@var{f} mod @var{n}} for sequence length
@code{@var{n}}.

NOTE that only one half of the relevant frequencies are represented in
the results, because the missing half can be constructed from the
provided half by complex conjugation.  Just adding up the squares of
all of the values in the result and dividing by the sequence length
does not give you the sum of squares of @code{@var{x}}; you have to
add in the missing part, too.  And remember that frequency zero counts
only once, and [for even-length sequences] the highest represented
frequency counts only once, too.

The returned values are such that if @code{x} contains a pure sine or
cosine wave, then the magnitude of the value in the appropriate
element of the result is equal to the amplitude of the wave times
@code{@var{n}} (for the very first element, and -- if @code{@var{n}}
is even -- also the very last element) or @code{@var{n}/2}.

If @code{/AMPLITUDES} is specified, then the returned values are
scaled such that their magitude is equal to the magnitude of the
corresponding wave.

The calculation speed of the algorithm depends strongly on the number
of data points in the dimension in which the algorithm is applied.
For quickest results, that number of data points should only have
factors equal to small prime numbers, such as 2, 3, and 5.

By default, seeks local maxima in @code{data} and returns their values.
@code{data} must be numerical and may have multiple dimensions.

If @code{@var{diagonal}} is specified, then it must be an array with one
element per dimension of @code{@var{data}}.  The elements that are equal
to 0 indicate which dimensions are not checked for a local maximum.  The
elements that are equal to 1 and 2 (after conversion to type
@code{LONG}) indicate in which dimensions checking is performed.  The
elements that are equal to 2 indicate in which dimensions checked
directions may be diagonal.  Elements equal to 1 indicate that no
diagonals are allowed in those dimensions.  All such directions either
have non-zero coordinate offsets only in those dimensions, or have only
a single non-zero coordinate offset (i.e., a non-diagnonal or orthogonal
direction).  Only approved directions are checked.  If
@code{@var{diagonal}} contains @code{n1} ones and @code{n2} twos, then
the number of directions per data element that will be considered is
equal to @code{m = 2^n2 - 1 + n1}.

For example, regard a two-dimensional array.  We'll call the first
dimension the east-west direction and the second one the north-south
dimension.  Then, if @code{@var{diagonal} = [1,0]}, values are returned
for all points that are local maxima in the east-west direction without
regards to any other direction.  If @code{@var{diagonal} = [1,1]}, then
all points are approved that are local maxima in the east-west direction
and also in the north-south direction, without regards to the other
(northeast-southwest, southeast-northwest) directions.  If
@code{@var{diagonal} = [2,2]}, then all directions are checked.

For a three-dimensional array, if @code{@var{diagonal} = [2,2,1]}, then
the only checked directions that have a non-zero third coordinate offset
are those that are along the 3rd axis.  If @code{@var{diagonal} =
[1,1,0]}, then only directions along (and not between) the first two
axes are checked.

If @code{/DEGREE} is specified, then the number of directions per data
element where the data shows a local maximum is returned instead.  This
number always lies between 0 and the total number @code{m} of directions
given above.  @code{FIND_MAX(@var{data}, /DEGREE) EQ m} returns an array
with 1s at all positions returned by @code{FIND_MAX(@var{data})}, but
the latter form is considerably faster because for each element it stops
checking as soon as a direction without a local maximum is found.  For
noise data in arbitrary numbers of dimensions, on average at most 2
local maximum determinations per data element are performed if
@code{/DEGREE} is not specified, compared to @code{m}, which is grows
exponentially with the number of dimensions in the worst case, if
@code{/DEGREE} is specified.

If @code{/SUBGRID} is specified, then the value of the local maximum is
taken from a quadratic hypersurface fitted to the local neighborhood of
the local maximum.

The used algorithm decides whether a particular data point is a local
maximum by looking at its nearest neighbors only.  This means that it
cannot decide if a region in which all adjacent data values are equal
constitutes a local maximum.  Such regions are ignored.

then returns coordinates to @code{data} in an array with the different
coordinates in the first dimension (i.e., if @code{x} is the result,
then @code{x(*,0)} contains the first coordinate of each found position.
@code{data} must be numerical and may have multiple dimensions.

If @code{@var{diagonal}} is specified, then it must be an array with one

the number of directions per data element in @code{n} dimensions that
will be considered is equal to @code{m = 2^n2 - 1 + n1}.

For example, regard a two-dimensional array.  We'll call the first
dimension the east-west direction and the second one the north-south
dimension.  Then, if @code{@var{diagonal} = [1,0]}, all points are
returned that are local maxima in the east-west direction without
regards to any other direction.  If @code{@var{diagonal} = [1,1]}, then
all points are returned that are local maxima in the east-west direction
and also in the north-south direction, without regards to the other
(northeast-southwest, southeast-northwest) directions.  If
@code{@var{diagonal} = [2,2]}, then all directions are checked.

For a three-dimensional array, if @code{@var{diagonal} = [2,2,1]}, then
the only checked directions that have a non-zero third coordinate offset
are those that are along the 3rd axis.  If @code{@var{diagonal} =

without a local maximum is found.  For noise data in arbitrary numbers

element are performed, compared to @code{m}, which is grows

the local maximum.

The used algorithm decides whether a particular data point is a local
maximum by looking at its nearest neighbors only.  This means that it
cannot decide if a region in which all adjacent data values are equal
constitutes a local maximum.  Such regions are ignored.

If @code{/OLD} is specified, then an older algorithm for two-dimensional
@code{@var{data}} is used instead, which always returns indices to
@code{data} (as if @code{/COORDS} is not specified).  In that case, each
value that is larger than the eight values immediately surrounding it is
a local maximum.  The edges of the image are not considered.  Of a
multi-pixel local maximum, only one position is returned.  Of a plateau
that is larger than three by three pixels, the algorithm cannot
determine whether it is a local maximum or not, and one position in the
plateau is returned.

curvature.  If @code{@var{diagonal}} contains @code{n1} ones and
@code{n2} twos, then the number of directions per data element in
@code{n} dimensions that will be considered is equal to @code{m = (3^n2
- 1)/2 + n1}.

For example, regard a two-dimensional array.  We'll call the first
dimension the east-west direction and the second one the north-south
dimension.  Then, if @code{@var{diagonal} = [1,0]}, all points are
returned that are local minima in the east-west direction without
regards to any other direction.  If @code{@var{diagonal} = [1,1]}, then
all points are returned that are local minima in the east-west direction
and also in the north-south direction, without regards to the other
(northeast-southwest, southeast-northwest) directions.  If
@code{@var{diagonal} = [2,2]}, then all directions are checked.

For a three-dimensional array, if @code{@var{diagonal} = [2,2,0]}, then
the only checked directions that have a non-zero third coordinate offset
are those that are along the 3rd axis.  If @code{@var{diagonal} =
[1,1,0]}, then only directions along the first two axes are checked.

If @code{/DEGREE} is specified, then the number of directions per data
element where the data shows a local minimum is returned instead.  This
number always lies between 0 and the total number @code{m} of directions
given above.  @code{FIND_MIN(@var{data}, /DEGREE) EQ m} returns an array
with 1s at all positions returned by @code{FIND_MIN(@var{data})}, but
the latter form is considerably faster because for each element it stops
checking as soon as a direction without a local minimum is found.  For
noise data in arbitrary numbers of dimensions, on average at most 2
local minimum comparisons per data element are performed if
@code{/DEGREE} is not specified, compared to @code{m}, which is grows
exponentially with the number of dimensions in the worst case, if
@code{/DEGREE} is specified..

The used algorithm decides whether a particular data point is a local
minimum by looking at its nearest neighbors only.  This means that it
cannot decide if a region in which all adjacent data values are equal
constitutes a local minimum.  Such regions are ignored.

Iterative non-linear fit to Gaussians, power functions, and user-defined
functions.  The selected function is evaluated at positions
@code{@var{x}} under guidance of trial model parameters and the found
model values are compared with @code{@var{y}}.  The model parameters are
adjusted to minimize the differences between the model values and
@code{@var{y}}.  The return value is an array containing the best found
model parameters and (at the end) the last fit quality number.

The fitted function depends on @code{@var{fit}}, @code{/GAUSSIANS}, and
@code{/POWERFUNC}.

@table @asis
@item @code{@var{fit}}
If specified, then it must be a string containing the name of a function
that takes arguments @code{@var{par}}, @code{@var{x}}, @code{@var{y}},
and, optionally, @code{@var{w}}, with @code{@var{par}} an array
containing the current fit parameters and @code{@var{w}} the weight of
each data point, and that returns the fit quality which is a positive
number that is closer to zero the better the fit is.  Minimization of
the fit quality is then the goal of the iterations.
@item /GAUSSIANS
If @code{@var{fit}} is not specified, then this keyword selects fitting
to the sum of one or more gaussian functions of the form
@code{@var{par}(0) + @code{@var{par}}(1)*exp(-((@code{@var{x}} -
@code{@var{par}}(2))/@code{@var{par}}(3))^2)}.  In this case
@code{@var{step}} must have four plus a multiple of three elements, and
for each extra set of three an extra gaussian is added.
@item /POWERFUNC
If @code{@var{fit}} is not specified, then this keyword selects fitting
to a general power function superimposed on a linear trend, of the form
@code{@var{par}(0) + @code{@var{par}}(1)*@code{@var{x}} +
@code{@var{par}}(2)*(@code{@var{x}} -
@code{@var{par}}(3))^@code{@var{par}}(4)}.
@end table

The fit parameters that are tried depend on @code{@var{start}},
@code{@var{step}}, @code{@var{lowbound}}, and @code{@var{hibound}}.

@table @var
@item x y
The data points to be fitted to.
@item niter
In each iteration cycle, @code{@var{niter}} different parameter sets are
tried.  @code{@var{niter}} defaults to 10.
@item start
contains the start values of the parameters.  This array must have a
number of elements equal to the number of fit parameters or the number
of fit parameters plus one.  In the latter case, the last element is
ignored.  (This is so that output from a previous call to @code{FIT} can
be entered as start values for the next call.)
@item step
contains the initial rms values by which the parameters are randomly
varied from iteration to iteration.  This array must have one element
for each fitted parameter.
@item lowbound
contains lower bounds on the parameters (default: no bounds).  This
array must have one element per fitted parameter.
@item hibound
contains upper bounds on the parameters (default: no bounds).  This
array must have one element per fitted parameter.
@end table

The stop criterion on the iterations depend on @code{@var{qthresh}},
@code{@var{pthresh}}, @code{@var{ithresh}}, @code{@var{dthresh}},
@code{@var{tthresh}}, and @code{@var{nsame}}, and parameter change
depends on @code{@var{fac}}.  Estimated errors on the parameters are
returned in @code{@var{err}}.

@table @var
@item qthresh
contains a threshold on the fit quality, below which iteration is
ceased.  Defaults to zero. 
@item pthresh
contains thresholds on the maximum absolute change in the best-so-far
parameters.  When the change in the last iteration cycle is smaller than
the corresponding threshold for all parameters, then the iteration is
ceased [NOTE: not yet implemented].  defaults to zero.
@item ithresh
contains a threshold on the number of iteration cycles, above which
iteration is ceased.  @code{@var{ithresh}} defaults to 1000.
@item dthresh
contains a threshold on the relative change in the fit quality since the
last iteration.  If the relative change is less than
@code{@var{dthresh}}, then iteration is ceased.  @code{@var{dthresh}}
defaults to 0.
@item tthresh
contains the maximum number of seconds that the fit process may take.
If at the end of an iteration it is more than @code{@var{tthresh}}
seconds later than when the fit process began, then iteration is
ceased.  If this variable is equal to 0, then no time threshold is
applied.  It defaults to 3600, i.e., one hour.
@item nsame
If the best-so-far parameters do not change during @code{@var{nsame}}
iteration cycles, then iterations are ceased.  @code{@var{nsame}}
defaults to 5. 
@item fac
contains a factor which limits the change of the rms spread of the
parameters from iteration cycle to iteration cycle.  The rms spread of
each parameter in the next iteration cycle equals the change in the
best-so-far value of that parameter since the last iteration cycle, but
is limited in change to a factor of between @code{@var{fac}} and
1/@code{@var{fac}}. 
@code{@var{fac}} defaults to 0.5.
@item err
If @code{@var{err}} is defined, then rough estimates for the formal
errors on the parameters are returned in it.
@end table

@table @code
@item /DOWN
When the best-so-far parameters do not change from one iteration cycle
to the next, then the rms parameter spread is decreased (if @code{/DOWN}
is specified, or by default) or increased (if @code{/NODOWN} is
specified) by a factor of 2 in the next iteration cycle.
@item /VOCAL
selects display of best-so-far parameters after each iteration cycle.
Displayed is: iteration rms-error: fit-parameters.  Only those fit
parameters for which the corresponding @code{@var{step}} value is
unequal to zero are shown, and at most the first twenty such parameters
are displayed.

[, /VOCAL])}

Seeks parameters @code{@var{par}} such that
@code{@var{funcname}(@var{par}, @var{x}, @var{y})} is as small as
possible, using the Simplex algorithm.  @code{@var{start}} specifies
the startup values for the parameters.  @code{@var{step}} specifies
the initial step size for each of the parameters, for searching for
the minimum.  @code{@var{funcname}} must be a @code{STRING} that names
the user-defined function to call to obtain the quality of the fit.
This function is assumed to return the sum of the square of the
residuals between the data and the model for the current set of
parameters.

@code{@var{ithresh}} specifies the maximum number of search iterations
that is done.  It defaults to 0, which corresponds to no iteration
limit.

The search algorithm searches a certain volume of parameter space for
the minimum.  During every iteration it updates the vertex
corresponding to the greatest function value, to home in on the
location of the minimum.  @code{@var{sthresh}} specifies below which
size of the search volume the iteration should stop.  The used measure
is the root-mean-square distance of all vertices from the center of
the search volume.  This size may increase or decrease, and need not
end up at zero.

If the best fit does not improve for more than @code{@var{nithresh}}
consecutive search iterations, then the iteration stops.  A value of 0
corresponds to no limit.  It defaults to 10 times the number of
parameters.

Upon exit, the last element of @var{par} contains the standard
deviation of the difference between @code{@var{y}} and
@code{@var{funcname}(@var{par}, @var{x}, @var{y})}.  If
@code{@var{errors}} is specified, then the estimated standard errors
on the parameters are returned in it. 

If @code{/VOCAL} is specified, then about every 2 seconds a line is
printed that lists (1) the iteration number, (2) the residual standard
error of the current best fit, (3) the difference with the previously
printed residual standard error, (4) a measure of the linear size of
the multidimensional volume that is being considered, (5) the
difference with the previously printed size, (6) the current best
values for the first few parameters that have a non-zero step size.

indicated FITS or FZ @code{@var{file}}.  (If the file is an FZ file,
then it must have a FITS header to be accepted.)  @code{@var{file}} may
be a string, which is taken as the name of the FITS file, or a number,
which is taken as the number of the logical unit on which the FITS file
is already open.  The following conditions generate an error: (1)
@code{@var{file}} is not a string or a number, (2) the logical unit
number is illegal, (3) no file is open on the indicated logical unit,
(4) the file cannot be opened for reading, (5) the file does not have
"SIMPLE " as the first word of its header, (6) @code{@var{key}} is not a
string, (7) @code{@var{key}} has more than 8 characters.  You may
specify @code{@var{key}} in mixed upper and lower case: a copy with all
upper case will be compared against the key words in the FITS header.
If the key is not found in the FITS header, then a zero is returned.

Tries to read the FITS file with the name indicated by
@code{@var{file}}.  The data is read into @code{@var{data}}, and the
header as a string array, if specified.  The first few standard FITS
keywords, which determine the data type and dimensions, are not included
in the returned header.

If the file includes a FITS extension, then its data is read into
@code{@var{ext_data}}, if specified, and its header into
@code{@var{ext_header}}, if specified.  If @code{@var{extvar_preamble}}
is specified, then it must be a @code{STRING} containing a preamble to
use for the creation of variables corresponding to data contained in the
extension.

If the file contains LUX compressed data (e.g., was written using
@code{FITS_WRITE} with compression enabled) and if @code{/NOTRANSLATE}
is specified, then the compressed data is returned @code{@var{data}}
transformed to a one-dimensional array of type @code{BYTE}.  If
@code{/NOTRANSLATE} is not specified, then the data is decompressed and
stored in @code{@var{data}} which is transformed to the appropriate type
and dimensions.

Unless @code{/RAWVALUES} is specified, the data values read from the
FITS file are modified according to the @code{BSCALE}, @code{BZERO}, and
@code{BLANK} FITS keywords from the file's header.  If the data values
are stored in the file as integers and @code{BSCALE} and @code{BZERO}
are integers, too, then the transformed data are returned as integers as
well.  In that case, the returned data type is the smallest one that can
hold any of the transformed values.

The function returns a @code{1} upon success, or a @code{0} otherwise.
The subroutine form generates an error if a problem is encountered.

@code{FITS_WRITE(@var{data}, @var{file} [, @var{header}, @var{slice}]
[, /VOCAL])}

Writes the numerical @code{@var{data}} array and optional string
@code{@var{header}} to the indicated @code{@var{file}} in FITS format,
with optional data compression.  @code{@var{data}} must be of a real
(i.e., not complex) data type.  @code{@var{header}} may be a single
string or a string array.  If @code{/VOCAL} is specified, then a message
is printed to the screen if compression was requested but for some
reason did not succeed.

The value of integer @code{@var{slice}} determines if data compression
is attempted.  If @code{@var{slice}} is zero, then the data is not
compressed.  If @code{@var{slice}} is positive, then lossless Rice
compression is attempted, as with @code{CRUNCH}.  If @code{@var{slice}}
is negative, then lossless Rice compression with run-length encoding is
attempted, as with @code{CRUNCHRUN}.  In either case, the magnitude of
@code{@var{slice}} is a compression parameter that can be tweaked to get
the best compression, similar to @code{!CRUNCH_SLICE}.  It should not be
greater than the number of bits per data value.

For a description of the FITS format adopted for LUX data, see @ref{LUX
FITS File Format}.

For uncompressed data, the following information is written into the
header of the FITS file: the standard @code{SIMPLE}, and the
@code{BITPIX} and @code{NAXES} lines that indicate the data type and
dimensions, and also the user-specified @code{@var{header}}, if any.

For compressed data, the same entries are included, but the
@code{BITPIX} and @code{NAXES} entries refer to the data after
compression, i.e., as included in the FITS file.  The following lines
come after the last @code{NAXES} entry: one with keyword @code{COMPRESS}
and value @code{'RICE '} or @code{'RICE RLE '} for straight and
run-length-encoded Rice compression, respectively; one @code{UBITPIX}
line, and @code{UNAXES} lines, corresponding to @code{BITPIX} and
@code{NAXES} but referring to the uncompressed @code{@var{data}}.

The treatment of the user-specified @code{@var{header}} depends on its
contents.  If the 9th character of the first (or only) string in
@code{@var{header}} is an equal sign (@code{=}), then the
@code{@var{header}} is assumed to contain a proper FITS header.  If
@code{@var{header}} is a string array, then each string element is
copied into one or more 80-character chunks of the output file, so the
elements do not themselves have to be 80 characters in size.  If
@code{@var{header}} is a string, then it is assumed to contain 80
characters for each FITS record.  Any excess characters after the last
full 80-character record are discarded.

If the @code{@var{header}} does not look like a proper FITS header, then
it is taken to be a general comment on the data.  If @code{@var{header}}
is a string, then it is chopped into 70-character parts and each part is
written to its own FITS record after a @code{COMMENT =} keyword.  If
@code{@var{header}} is a string array, then each element is written to
one or more of its own @code{COMMENT} lines.

@code{GMST06(@var{jdut}, @var{jdtt})}

[SOFA] Returns Greenwich mean sidereal time in radians according to a
model that is consistent with IAU 2006 precession.  @code{@var{jdut}}
is the Julian Date (UT1).  @code{@var{jdtt}} is the Julian Date (TT)
of the same instant. @code{@var{jdut}} is needed to predict the Earth
rotation, and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If
@code{@var{jdtt}} is set equal to @code{@var{jdut}} then errors of
order 100 microarcseconds result.  Both parameters must have the same
dimensions, and the result has those same dimensions, too.

@code{@var{axis}}.  Both @code{@var{axis}} and @code{@var{width}} may
have more than one element, in which case multiple smoothing passes are
performed using subsequent values of these arguments.

Keyword @code{/FULLNORM} specifies that the weighted sum of data values
is always normalized with the full sum of weights in the kernel: it adds
in data values beyond the edges of @code{@var{data}} as zeros.

Keyword @code{/BALANCED} reduces the width of the included data set so
that the weighted and included data is always balanced around the
central point: in this way, a smoothed version of a straight line is
also a straight line.

Keyword @code{/ALL} specifies that all axes must be smoothed along, but
is ignored if @code{@var{axis}} is specified.

@code{HILBERT(@var{data} [, @var{axes}, @var{direction}, /BACK, /ALL,
/AVGKEEP, /HIGHKEEP])}

Returns a discrete Hilbert transform of the @code{@var{data}} along the
indicated @code{@var{axes}} in the indicated @code{@var{direction}}.
The Hilbert transform changes the phases of the Fourier components in
the data by 90 degrees, replacing sines by cosines and cosines by sines
(with appropriate signs).  By default, the phases are shifted forward in
the first dimension.

If @code{@var{direction}} (after transformation to an integer) is
negative, then the phases are shifted back.  If @code{@var{direction}}
is zero or positive, then the phases are shifted forward.  If
@code{@var{direction}} is not specified, then @code{/BACK} implies the
backward shift.

If @code{@var{axes}} is specified, then it is taken to contain the axes
along which transformation is to be done.  No axis may appear more than
once.  The axes need not be in any specific order.  If @code{@var{axes}}
is not specified, then if @code{/ALL} is specified, all axes are
treated.  If neither @code{@var{axes}} nor @code{/ALL} are specified,
then the first axis is assumed.

By default, the forward and backward transforms are almost each other's
inverse: If you apply the one and the equivalent other in succession,
then you get the original data back, except that the Hilbert transform
sets averages to zero and also removes the very highest frequency from
the data (which by definition always has its sine component equal to
zero).  However, keyword @code{/AVGKEEP} retains the average, and
keyword @code{/HIGHKEEP} retains the highest frequency.

The power spectrum of the default Hilbert transform of @code{x} is equal
to the power spectrum of @code{x} itself, except at zero frequency
(corresponding to the average) and at the very highest frequency.

@subsection HIST

@code{HIST(@var{x} [, @var{l}] [, /FIRST, /IGNORELIMIT, /INCREASELIMIT,

Returns the histogram (binsize 1) of @code{@var{x}}.  If @code{@var{l}}
is not specified, then the histogram runs between values @code{!HISTMIN}
(zero or negative) and @code{!HISTMAX}, and cannot exceed
@code{!MAXHISTSIZE} bins, unless @code{/IGNORELIMIT} or
@code{/INCREASELIMIT} are specified.  @code{/IGNORELIMIT} causes the
limit to be ignored, so that histograms of arbitrary (possibly very
large!) size are allowed.  @code{/INCREASELIMIT} increases the value of
@code{!MAXHISTSIZE} if necessary to accomodate the current histogram.
If @code{/FIRST} is specified and @code{@var{x}} is multidimensional,
then histograms along the first dimension are returned.  By default, a
single histogram of the whole array is returned.

By default, a warning is issued if @code{@var{x}} contains negative
values (so that the first element of the histogram does not refer to
value 0 from @code{@var{x}} but to the most negative value).  If
@code{/SILENT} is specified, then the warning is suppressed.

If @code{@var{l}} is specified, then in it a list of unique values in
@code{@var{x}} is returned, in ascending order, and the return value of
the function is the corresponding frequency table.  In this case, the
keywords are ignored, and there is no specific limit on the size of the
histogram.  This form of the function is useful if one expects that the
histogram is large yet sparsely occupied.

Inserts @code{@var{source}} in @code{@var{target}} starting at the
position indicated by the coordinates indicated by @code{@var{x}} and
the following arguments, which must all be real scalars.

If there is a single coordinate argument, then @code{@var{target}} and
@code{@var{source}} are regarded as one-dimensional arrays and
@code{@var{x}} indicates the offset into @code{@var{target}} at which
the contents of @code{@var{source}} is to be inserted.

If there is more than one coordinate argument, then there must be one
coordinate argument for each dimension of @code{@var{target}}, and
@code{@var{source}} must have the same number of dimensions as
@code{@var{target}}.  The @code{@var{source}} data is then inserted into
the @code{@var{target}} starting at the indicated coordinates, taking
into account the dimensional structure of both.

If any element of @code{@var{source}} would be "inserted" beyond the
boundaries of @code{@var{target}}, then an error is generated before any
insertions have been done.

NOTE: @code{INSERT} is mostly obsolete, because insertion using
subscripts (@ref{Insertion}) can do everything that @code{INSERT} can
do, and is more versatile as well.  @code{INSERT} is kept around because
it was written b
fore insertion through subscripts became available and
it is used in quite a few existing LUX version 1 scripts.

Starting with LUX 3.1.17, @code{INSERT} is again backwardly compatible
with the LUX 1 version.  In LUX 2, @code{INSERT} was made more versatile
and got the argument list @code{INSERT, @var{target}, @var{source} [,
@var{origin}, @var{axes}]}, where @code{@var{origin}} was a list of
coordinates in the indicated @code{@var{axes}}.  The LUX 2 argument list
was not totally backwardly compatible with the LUX 1 argument list.
When insertion through subscripts became available, @code{INSERT} could
revert to its LUX 1 form.

@code{[JPEG]} Retrieves @code{@var{array}} and @code{@var{header}} from
JPEG-compressed @code{@var{file}}.  If @code{@var{header}} is not

If @code{/GREYSCALE} is selected, then a greyscale image is returned
even if the file contains a color image.  Specifying @code{/GREYSCALE}
and specifying a non-unit value for @code{shrink} decreases the amount
of time that the reading and decompression takes.  RGB values are
returned in a three-dimensional array, with the first dimension (of size
three) selecting the color and the remaining dimensions selecting
location.  Greyscale values are returned in a two-dimensional array.

The function returns @code{1} on success, @code{0} on failure.  The
subroutine generates an error on failure.

@subsection LEGENDRE
@findex LEGENDRE

@code{LEGENDRE( @var{x}, @var{lmax} [, /NORMALIZE])}

Calculates values of the associated Legendre polynomials of orders
@code{l} from zero through @code{@var{lmax}} and degrees @code{m} from
zero through @code{l}, at ordinate @code{@var{x}}.  @code{@var{x}} must
be between @code{-1} and @code{+1}, inclusive, and @code{@var{lmax}}
must be positive.

The associated Legendre polynomial of order @code{l} and degree @code{m}
is defined as
@ifinfo
@code{P(l,m;x) = [(-1)^m (1 - x^2)^(m/2)]/(2^l l!)} times the
@code{l+m}th derivative of @code{(x^2 - 1)^l} with respect to @code{x}.
@end ifinfo
@tex
$ P_l^m(x) = {{(-1)^m} \over {2^l l!}} (1 - x^2)^{m/2} {{{\rm d}^{l+m}
(x^2 - 1)^l} \over {{\rm d}x^{l+m}}}. $
@end tex

The values for the associated Legendre polynomials can get very large.
In particular, the magnitude of the associated Legendre polynomial of
degree and order @code{l} is approximately equal to the square root of
the factorial of @code{l} (@code{SQRT(GAMMA(l + 1))}), which is too
great to fit in even a double-precision (@code{DOUBLE}) variable on a
32-bit computer when @code{l} exceeds about 170.

If @code{/NORMALIZE} is specified, then the values of the associated
Legendre polynomials are normalized appropriately for the derivation of
the related spherical harmonics.  In that case, the returned values are
defined as
@ifinfo
@code{y(l,m;x) = sqrt((2 l - 1)/(4 pi) * ((l - m)!)/((l + m)!))
P(l,m;x)}
@end ifinfo
@tex
$ y_l^m(x) = \sqrt{{{2l + 1}\over{4\pi}} {{(l - m)!}\over{(l + m)!}}}
P_l^m(x) $
@end tex
which are of order unity or less.  In terms of these values, the
spherical harmonics are defined as
@ifinfo
@code{Y(l,m; theta, phi) = y(l,m; cos(theta)) exp(i m phi)}.
@end ifinfo
@tex
$ Y_l^m(\theta,\phi) = y_l^m(\cos\theta) e^{i m \phi} $.
@end tex

The calculated values are returned in a @code{DOUBLE} array.  The values
are sorted by increasing order @code{l}, and secondarily by increasing
degree @code{m}.  The number of returned values is equal to
@code{(@var{lmax} + 1)*(@var{lmax} + 2)/2}.  The @code{l + 1} values for
order @code{l} start at index @code{l*(l + 1)/2}.

@code{LSMOOTH(@var{image}, @var{vx}, @var{vy} [, /BOXCAR, /GAUSSIAN,
/ONESIDED, /TWOSIDED, /NORMALIZE])}

Returns a directionally smoothed version of @code{@var{image}}.
@code{@var{vx}} and @code{@var{vy}} contain the two coordinates of the
direction at each point.  The direction of the stream vector is the
direction of the streamline through the point, or, if @code{/STRAIGHT}
is specified, a weighted average or total of data points on the straight
line which is tangential to the streamline through that point.  For each
point, its data value is spread across data points on the streamline
through that point.  The smoothing width is taken from the length of the
stream vector.

By default, or if @code{/ONESIDED} is selected, then the target interval
extends, for each point, to only one side of that point (determined by
the direction of the stream vector).  If @code{/TWOSIDED} is selected,
then the target interval extends in both directions from the starting
point (determined by the direction of the stream vector and the exactly
opposite direction).

By default (or if @code{/BOXCAR} is specified), the spreading is of the
boxcar type, and the total length of the boxcar is equal to the length
of the stream vector (if @code{/TWOSIDED} is specified or implied), or
to one half of the length of the stream vector (if @code{/ONESIDED} is
specified).  If @code{/GAUSSIAN} is specified, then the spreading is
gaussian instead, with the length of the stream vector indicating the
FWHM of the gaussian kernel.

By default, a value that is spread to a particular data element is
multiplied by the length of the segment of the streamline or straight
line that falls within the data element, and by a gaussian weight (if
@code{/GAUSSIAN} was selected), but is not normalized to take into
account the smoothing width.  If @code{/NORMALIZE} is specified, then
the spread values are normalized with the smoothing width, too, so that
the total of the smoothed data equals the total of the unsmoothed data
(except for edge effects).

@code{LSMOOTH} is very similar to @code{DSMOOTH}, except that in
@code{LSMOOTH} a particular source value is spread along its associated
streamline (or tangent), whereas in @code{DSMOOTH} a particular target
value is constructed from source values taken from its associated
streamline (or tangent).

@code{LSQ(@var{x}, @var{y} [, WEIGHTS=@var{w}, COV=@var{cov},
ERR=@var{err}, CHISQ=@var{chisq}, /FORMAL, /REDUCE])}

Returns a linear least-squares fit of @code{@var{y}} to @code{@var{x}}.
@code{@var{x}} must have either the same dimensional structure as
@code{@var{y}}, or the same plus one more dimension.  In the former
case, the number of parameters to be fitted is taken equal to 1,
otherwise it is equal to the number of elements in the last dimension of
@code{@var{x}}.  The model to be fitted is @code{@var{y} =
@code{@var{a}}(0)*@code{@var{x}}(...,0) +
@code{@var{a}}(1)*@code{@var{x}}(...,1) + ...}, where @code{@var{a}}
stands for the parameters sought from the fit, which are returned by
this function.

Optionally, a weight can be assigned to each data point, in
@code{@var{w}}.  These weights should be equal to the inverse of the
variance associated with each data point.

If @code{@var{cov}} is specified, then by default a covariance matrix of
the parameters of the fit is returned in it, with the variances on the
diagonal and the covariances in the off-diagonal elements.  If
@code{/REDUCE} is specified, then a reduced covariance matrix is
returned instead, in which the diagonal elements contain the standard
deviations, the off-diagonal part that contains most of the first
dimension contains cross-correlation coefficients, and the off-diagonal
part that contains most of the second dimension contains the covariances
(the same as when @code{/REDUCE} is not specified).  The matrix is
square in any case.

If @code{@var{err}} is specified, then the weighted root-mean-square
value of the residual errors (after subtraction of the model values) is
returned in it.

If @code{@var{chisq}} is specified, then the chi-square value of the fit
is returned in it.

The magnitudes of the (co)variances in @code{@var{cov}} and of
@code{@var{chisq}} are only meaningful if proper weights were specified
in @code{@var{w}} as described above.  In that case, chi-square should
ideally be equal to the number of data points minus one.  If the
chi-square is much smaller than that, then the variances
@code{1/@var{w}} were apparently overestimated.  If the
chi-square is much greater than that, then either the variances were
underestimated, or the linear model is not suitable for the data.

If no weights were specified, or if the proper normalization of the
values specified in @code{@var{w}} is not known, then you can derive
formal estimates for the errors on the model parameters by specifying
the @code{/FORMAL} keyword.  In that case, the variance on the data
values is assumed equal to @code{@var{err}^2*n/(n - 1)}, where @code{n}
is the number of data points (taken to be equal to the sum of all
elements of @code{@var{w}} if @code{@var{w}} is specified), and the
variances on the model parameters are scaled accordingly.  (The
correction factor involving @code{n} is necessary to get an unbiased
estimator.)  This corresponds to forcing chi-square equal to the ideal
value of @code{n - 1}.

@code{MAX(x, 0)} returns the maximum value over all values of the first
dimension, and @code{MAX(x, [0,1])} returns the maximum over all values
of the first two dimensions.

By default, the result has a number of dimensions equal to the number of
dimensions in @code{array} minus the number of elements of @code{arg}.
If @code{/KEEPDIMS} is specified, then the dimensions indicated by
@code{arg} are not omitted but set to 1.

If @code{@var{arg}} is a numerical array with the same number of
elements as @code{@var{array}}, then its elements indicate the class
each corresponding element of @code{@var{array}} belongs to and the
maximum value in each class is returned, with the maximum of class 0 or
the most negative class in the first element of the result.

The last found maximum value is stored in @code{!LASTMAX} and its index
in @code{!LASTMAXLOC}, and the corresponding numbers for the minima in
@code{!LASTMIN} and @code{!LASTMINLOC}.  For complex arrays, the values
stored in @code{!LASTMAX} and @code{!LASTMIN} are the magnitudes
of the corresponding extreme values.

E.g. if @code{x = [[[1,7]],[[3,5]]]} then @code{MAX(x) = 7 MAX(x,0) =
[7,5] MAX(x,1) = [3,7]}.

@code{MAXFILTER(@var{x} [[, @var{axes}], @var{widths}])}

Applies a maximum filter to one or more dimensions @code{@var{axes}} of
@code{@var{x}}, over @code{@var{widths}} elements.  If @code{@var{axes}}
is not specified, then @code{@var{x}} is treated as a 1D array.
@code{@var{widths}} must be a scalar or an array with the same number of

to the edge to yield full-width results, the nearest full-width result
is returned.

@code{MAXLOC(@var{array} [, @var{arg}] [, /KEEPDIMS])}

Returns the location of one or more maximum values from the numerical
@code{@var{array}}, expressed as indices into the array.  For real data
types, the maximum is the value closest to infinity.  For complex data
types, the maximum is the value with the greatest magnitude.  Generally,
@code{@var{arg}} indicates which dimensions are included in searching
for a maximum.  There must not be any duplicates in the elements of
@code{@var{arg}}.  For example, @code{MAXLOC(x, 0)} returns the location
of maximum value over all values of the first dimension, and
@code{MAXLOC(x, [0,1])} returns the location of maxima over all values
of the first two dimensions.

By default, the result has a number of dimensions equal to the number of

@code{MDIAGONAL(@var{values})}

rows and columns equal to the number of elements in
@code{@var{values}}.

@c -------------------------------------
@node MEAN, MEDFILTER, MDIAGONAL, Internal Routines
@subsection MEAN
@findex MEAN

@code{MEAN(@var{x} [, @var{mode}, POWER=@var{power},
WEIGHTS=@var{weights}, /FLOAT, /DOUBLE, /KEEPDIMS])}

By default, returns the arithmetic average of numerical array
@code{@var{x}}: the sum divided by the number of summed values.

If @code{@var{mode}} is a scalar or an array with a size different from
that of @code{@var{x}}, then it indicates the dimension(s) along which
averages are calculated for each combination of the remaining
coordinates.  In that case, if also @code{/KEEPDIMS} is specified, then
the dimension(s) along which the averages are calculated are set to 1 in
the result.  If @code{/KEEPDIMS} is not set, then such dimensions are
omitted from the result, and if only a single number is returned, then
it is returned as a scalar.

If @code{@var{mode}} is an array with the same number of elements as
@code{@var{x}}, then each element of @code{@var{mode}} identifies the
(scalar) class to which each corresponding element of @code{@var{x}}
belongs, and then an average is returned for each class.  The first
element of the result refers to class @code{0} (if no class is
negative), or to the most negative class.

If @code{@var{power}} is specified, then it must be an integer scalar
(negative, zero, or positive), and each data value is raised to the
indicated power before being passed on to the calculation of the
arithmetic average.

If @code{@var{weights}} is specified, then it must be a numerical array
with the same dimensions as @code{@var{x}} (or merely the same number of
elements, if deviations are calculated by class), and then each of its
elements indicates the weight of the corresponding element of
@code{@var{x}}, and then weighted averages are returned.  The
@code{@var{weights}} are copied to a version with the same data type as
@code{@var{x}} for the internal calculations (except that the copy is
kept real even if @code{@var{x}} is complex).

Complex numbers are supported.

The data type of the result is at least as great as the data type of
@code{@var{x}}, and not less than @code{LONG}.  If @code{/FLOAT} is
specified, then the result is at least of type @code{FLOAT}.  If
@code{/DOUBLE} is specified, then the result is of type @code{DOUBLE}
(or @code{CDOUBLE} if @code{@var{x}} is complex).

Examples, with @code{X = [[[6.0, 4, 3]],[[8, 2, 4]]]} and @code{C = [2.0, 2,
2, 2, 1, 1]}:

To print the average along the first dimension (dimension 0, rows) of
@code{X}: 
@example
LUX>T,MEAN(X,0)
      4.333333      4.666667
@end example

And along the second dimension (dimension 1, columns):
@example
LUX>T,MEAN(X,1)
             7             3           3.5
@end example

To subtract the column average from each column of @code{X}:
@example
LUX>X -= MEAN(X,1,/KEEPDIMS)
LUX>T,X(*,0)
            -1             1          -0.5
LUX>T,X(*,1)
             1            -1           0.5
@end example

To print the arithmetic averages of @code{X} for the classes identified
by @code{C}:
@example
LUX>T,MEAN(X,C)
             0             3          5.25
@end example
Class 0 yields @code{0} because there are no elements @code{0} in
@code{C}.  Class 1 yields the arithmetic average (@code{3}) of elements
@code{2, 4}, and class 2 yield the average (@code{5.25}) of elements
@code{6, 4, 3, 8}.

To calculate the average of @code{x^2}:
@example
LUX>T,MEAN(X,POWER=2)
      48.33333
@end example
In general, @code{MEAN(X,POWER=p)} is equivalent to @code{MEAN(X^p)},
but the first form does not generate a temporary variable for storage of
@code{X^p} and is generally faster because it can take advantage of the
exponent being integral.

Beware that @code{FLOAT/CFLOAT} numbers have only about 6 significant
digits (on a 32-bit machine), so that the relative accuracy of
@code{FLOAT/CFLOAT} results from @code{TOTAL} may be as bad as
1E-6*sqrt(@code{@var{n}}) where @code{@var{n}} is the number of data
points!  When in doubt, use @code{TOTAL(x, /DOUBLE)} or @code{DSUM},
which have a relative accuracy about a thousand million times better
than @code{FLOAT/CFLOAT} @code{TOTAL}.

For example, @code{MIN(x, 0)} returns the minimum value over all values

Returns the matrix product of two- or more-dimensional real-valued
column-major matrices @code{@var{m1}} and @code{@var{m2}}.  The matrix
product is calculated across the first two dimensions only.  The 1st
(column) dimension of @code{@var{m1}} must equal the 2nd (row)
dimension of @code{@var{m2}}.

If @code{@var{m1}} or @code{@var{m2}} have more than two dimensions,
then they can be multiplied in ``inner'' or ``outer'' fashion,
selected by @code{/INNER} (the default) or @code{/OUTER},
respectively.

By default, or if @code{/INNER} is selected, then dimensions beyond
the first two must be equal in both arguments, and one matrix product
of the first two dimensions is calculated for each element of
@code{@var{m1}} beyond the first two dimension and for the
corresponding element of @code{@code{m2}}.

For example, if @code{X = INDGEN(DBLARR(2,3,4))} and @code{Y =

MPRODUCT(X,Y,/INNER)} gets dimensions 5, 3, 4, and @code{Z(*,*,I)} is
equal to @code{MPRODUCT(X(*,*,I),Y(*,*,I))}.

If @code{/OUTER} is selected, then dimensions beyond the first two do
not need to be equal in both arguments, and one matrix product of the
first two dimensions is calculated for each possible combination of
one element of @code{@var{m1}} beyond the first two dimensions and one
element of @code{@var{m2}} beyond the first two dimensions.

For example, if @code{X = INDGEN(DBLARR(2,3,4)} and @code{Y =

@table @var
@item data
The 2D or 3D array in which orientations are to be determined.
@item widths
must be a 2 or 3-element vector containing the FWHM of the Gaussian
smoothing kernels applied in the dimensions (0 means no smoothing).
@item grid
is a 2 or 3-element vector containing the desired dimensions of the

dimensions as @code{@var{data}}.
@item aspect
specifies the dimensions of a pixel, if they do not have an aspect ratio
of 1.
@item order
contains the approximation order of the calculations, a number between 1
and 4 (default, most accurate).
@item orientation
The found orientation is returned in this argument (if specified),
unless @code{/GETJ} is specified.  The orientation is expressed in the
2D case as an angle in radians measured counterclockwise from the
positive x-axis, and in the 3D case as a 2-element vector containing the
x and y coordinates of the orientation vector relative to a unit z
coordinate. 
@item values
The found eigenvalues (measures for the data gradients in the principal
directions) are returned in this argument (if specified), unless
@code{/GETJ} is specified.  The eigenvalues are returned in descending
order.
@item wavenumber

By default, the determined local wavenumber in the direction of the
found orientation is returned in this argument (if specified), unless
@code{/GETJ} is specified.  If @code{/PERPENDICULAR} is specified, then
-- for two-dimensional data only -- the local wavenumber in the
direction perpendicular to the found orientation is returned instead.
The wavenumber is measured in units of one data element.  A data set
with values equal to sin(x) returns a wavenumber of 1 for the
perpendicular wavenumber, and 0 for the parallel wavenumber.
If a random data set is smoothed over FWHM @code{@var{w}} in one direction,
then the parallel local wavenumber is on average equal to about
1.65/@code{@var{w}}.

@subsubsection ORIENTATION details

Conceptually, the orientation is determined by fitting (in least-squares
fashion) a line to the Fourier transform of a small, apodized part of
the data array centered on the point at which the orientation is to be
determined.  The fit can be determined by calculating the eigenvector
corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of a tensor whose elements are
suitable integrals involving the Fourier transform of the data.  If one
calls the spectral density of the data (i.e., the square of the value of
the Fourier transform) a "mass density", and substitutes "space
coordinate" for "wavenumber" in the integrals, then the tensor is the
inertia tensor of the "mass" distribution, and therefore this method of
calculating orientations is known as the @emph{(inertia) tensor method}.

Fortunately, the calculation of the elements of the inertia tensor can
all be performed in the space domain, by using suitable spatial
derivatives, so no Fourier transforms are actually calculated.  During
the calculations, a spatial differencing scheme is used to approximate
the spatial derivatives.  The order (and accuracy) of the differencing
scheme is governed by argument @code{@var{order}}.

The eigenvalues of the inertia tensor measure the squared gradient of
the data values along the principal axes (indicated by the
eigenvectors).  A zero eigenvalue indicates that the data does not vary
along the corresponding principal axis.  Such a principal axis may then
be said to indicate the orientation of the data.

In practice, the eigenvalues are hardly ever exactly equal to zero, but
if one eigenvalue is much smaller than all other ones, then the
eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue can still be said to
indicate the orientation of the data.  In general, the eigenvector
corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the inertia tensor is taken
to indicate the orientation, and that orientation is returned by
@code{ORIENTATION}.

The square of the returned local wavenumber is equal to the average of
the square of the component of the wavevector that is aligned with the
found orientation, weighted with the square of the spectral density in
each small apodized area around the central pixel.  As for the local
orientation, all local-wavenumber calculations are done completely in
the spatial domain, using suitable spatial derivatives.

The local wavenumber in any of the principal directions is equal to the
sum of all eigenvalues except the eigenvalue corresponding to the chosen
principal direction, and the result divided by the local power (see at
@code{/GETJ}).

History:

The procedure that is used in LUX for calculating local orientation in
the space domain from an inertia tensor is described by Jahne [a-umlaut]
(1993).  He ascribes the idea of determining local orientation in the
Fourier domain to Bigun [u-umlaut] and Granlund (1987).  The LUX
procedure for calculating the local wavenumber was invented by L. Strous
(1998) analogous to Jahne's [a-umlaut] procedure for local orientation.

that is closest to the requested gray level.

There are separate gray scales for plotting to the Postscript file or to
the screen, so that plotting at a gray level of 1 yields results with
maximum contrast in both cases, even if the background of the images is
black and that of the Postscript file white.

In particular, if @code{SET,/WHITEBACKGROUND} is set, then a gray value
of 0 or less corresponds in LUX windows to white and a gray value of 1
or more to black.  If @code{SET,/WHITEBACKGROUND} is not set, then a
gray value of 0 or less corresponds to black in a LUX window and a gray
value of 1 or more to white.

A pen change affects output to the Postscript file as well as output in
the current LUX window (indicated by @code{!WINDOW}), but not in other
LUX windows. 

If @code{/STANDARDGRAY} is specified, then the used gray scale always
has the gray level of 0 correspond to black, and a gray level of 1 to
white.

@code{PENCOLOR [, @var{color}]}

Sets or displays the pen color.  If @code{@var{color}} is specified, it
must be a string containing a valid color name, or a numerical array
with three elements specifying red, green, and blue components between 0
(absent) and 1 (full presence).

Which color names are valid depends on whether you are connected to an X
server.  If you are connected to an X server (for example, if you are
plotting to a window, or if you have one or more LUX windows open
already, or if you've executed @code{XOPEN} and not @code{XCLOSE}), then
all color names that X supports are valid, including names such as
@code{black} and @code{blue} (@ref{Incidental Colors}).  If you are not
connected to an X server and you are plotting to a PostScript file
(i.e., @code{!PDEV} is equal to 1), then only @code{RGB} and @code{RGBI}
color names are valid (@ref{Incidental Colors}).

@code{PLAN94(@var{jdtdb}, @var{planet})}

[SOFA] Returns the approximate heliocentric position and velocity at
TDB Julian Date @code{@var{jdtdb}} of major planet @code{@var{planet}}
(1 = Mercury, 2 = Venus, 3 = EMB, 4 = Mars, ..., 8 = Neptune).
@code{@var{planet}} must be a @code{SCALAR} or an @code{ARRAY} with
exactly 1 element.  The result has the same dimensions as
@code{@var{jdtdb}} except that two dimensions equal to 3 and 2 are
prefixed.  If the result is @code{pv}, then @code{pv(*,0,/ALL)} are
the heliocentric equatorial J2000.0 (mean equator & epoch) cartesian
coordinates in AU, and @code{pv(*,1,/ALL)} are the corresponding
heliocentric J2000.0 cartesian velocities (AU/d).

The algorithm is due to Simon, Bretagnon et al. (1994).  Comparison
with JPL ephemeris DE102 says that during the years 1800 - 2050 the
maximum errors in longitude L (arcsec), in the numerical order of the
planets given above: 4, 5, 6, 17, 71, 81, 86, 11.  The maximum errors
in latitude B (arcsec) are: 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 13, 7, 1.  The maximum
errors in radial distance R (Mm) are: 0.3, 0.8, 1, 7.7, 76, 267, 712,
253.

During the years 1000 - 3000 the accuracy is no worse than 1.5 times
that over the years 1800 - 2050.

Comparison with the JPL DE200 ephemeris give the following RMS errors
during the years 1960 - 2025: for position (Mm) 0.334, 1.06, 2.01,
7.69, 71.7, 199, 564, 158; for velocity (m/s) 0.437, 0.855, 0.815,
1.98, 7.7, 19.4, 16.4, 14.4.

Comparison against DE200 during the years 1800 - 2100 gave the
following maximum absolute differencs (and essentially the same using
DE406):  longitude L (arcsec): 7, 7, 9, 26, 78, 87, 86, 11; latitude B
(arcsec): 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 14, 7, 2; radial distance R (Mm): 0.5, 1.1,

[, /LII, /LIO, /LOI, /LOO] [, /KEEP, /WHOLE, /CLIPBARS]}

Produces a plot of @code{@var{ydata}} versus @code{@var{xdata}}.

@table @var
@item xdata ydata
The x and y coordinates of the data points; they must be arrays.  If
@code{@var{xdata}} is not specified, then
@code{INDGEN(@code{@var{ydata}})} is assumed.  If @code{@var{x}} and
@code{@var{y}} have unequal numbers of elements, then the smallest
number between the two is used, and excess elements are ignored.
@item xerrors yerrors
If @code{@var{xerrors}} is specified, then horizontal error bars are
drawn on all points that have non-zero errors.  Likewise,
@code{@var{yerrors}} yields vertical error bars.  These arguments must
be arrays.  @code{@var{xerrors}} and @code{@var{yerrors}} must have
either as many elements as the smaller of @code{@var{x}} and
@code{@var{y}}, or twice as many.  In the first case, the error bar
extends equally far on either side of the data point.  In the second
case, the errors array is interpreted as a two-dimensional array with 2
elements in its second dimension, and @code{array(*,0)} is taken for the
extent above or to the left of the data point, and @code{array(*,1)} for
the extent below or to the right of the data point.
@item symbol
The number of the symbol type with which the locations of the data
points are indicated.  See below.
@item line
The number of the line style with which the data points are connected.
See below.
@item xbarsize ybarsize
Specify the vertical size of horizontal error bars and the horizontal
size of vertical error bars, respectively.  The values are copied into
@code{!PLXERRB} and @code{!PLYERRB} and remain in effect until they are
changed again.
@item xtitle ytitle
The labels for the x and y axes (strings).  All strings that
@code{CALLIG} accepts are legal.
@item title
The label that goes above the plot (a string).  All strings that
@code{CALLIG} accepts are legal.
@item breaks
The indices of the data points at which the plotted curve is broken,
i.e. no connecting line is drawn to the next data point.
@item dashsize
scales the size of the dashes in non-solid lines.
@item xfmt yfmt
specifies the output format for the labels along the horizontal and
vertical axes, respectively (@ref{Formatted Input/Output}).  These
formats default to @code{%1g}. 
@end table

Only the relative order of arguments of the same data class (scalar,
array, string) matters; i.e. @code{PLOT, @var{xtitle}, @var{ydata},
@var{xerrors}, @var{ytitle}} is a valid call.

The first 6 keywords are coordinate system keywords.  The next four
select a particular plot style: linear-linear (@code{/LII}),
linear-logarithmic (@code{/LIO}), logarithmic-linear (@code{/LOI}), or
logarithmic-logarithmic (@code{/LOO}).  The global variable
@code{!PLTYP} is adjusted accordingly, so the new plot style remains in
effect until it is explicitly changed again.  @code{/KEEP} suppresses
clearing the device before drawing the plot.  @code{/WHOLE} suppresses
drawing of lines between points that lie wholly outside of the plot
window (though symbols may still be drawn at the positions where such
lines cross the edges of the plot window).  @code{/CLIPBARS} selects
clipping of error bars if they extend beyond the edges of the plot
window. 

In logarithmic plots, only positive values are considered, the ratio
between the used plot limits is at least 10, labels are displayed at
factors of 10 only, and minor tick marks are displayed at all integer
multiples (up to 9) of the previous labeled tick mark's label.

In bar plots (line style 20), two successive data points are connected
by a horizontal segment at the y value of the first point and a vertical
segment at the x value of the second point, and the last data point gets
a horizontal segment at its y value extending over 1 data unit to the
right of its x value.

@subsubsection Plot and Line Styles

The arguments to @code{SYMBOL} and @code{LINE} must be integers between
@minus{}9 and 29, inclusive.

The symbol and line styles are as follows.  Styles 1 through 9 refer to
symbols at the locations of the data points, connected by lines.  The
symbols are:
@enumerate 1
@item dots (.)
@item plus (+)
@item times (x)
@item box
@item upward-pointing triangle
@item diamond
@item downward-pointing triangle
@item four-line asterisk (+ and x combined)
@item circle
@end enumerate
Styles @minus{}9 to @minus{}1 refer to symbols at the locations of the
data points, without connecting lines.  The symbols are the same as for
the corresponding positive numbers.  Style 0 is invisible.  Styles 10
through 19 refer to variously dotted and dashed lines connecting the
data points.  The styles are:
@enumerate 10
@item short-dashed
@item medium-dashed
@item long-dashed
@item dot-short-dashed
@item dot-medium-dashed
@item dotted
@item dot-dot-dashed
@item dot-dash-dashed
@item dot-dot-dash-dashed
@item short-medium-dashed
@end enumerate
Style 20 refers to a bar-style plot in which successive data points are
connected by a horizontal and a vertical line.  Styles 21 through 29
refer again to symbols at the locations of the data points, connected by
lines.  The symbols are:
@enumerate 21
@item E
@item F
@item G
@item H
@item I
@item J
@item K
@item L
@item M
@end enumerate

You can use @code{LINE} to select the line style connecting the symbols
selected with a positive @code{SYMBOL}.  By default, the symbols are
connected by solid lines.

@subsubsection Global Variables Associated with PLOT

The following global variables are associated with and govern some
aspects of a plot:

@table @code
@item !DASHSIZE
A scaling factor for the size of the dashes in the plot lines.  Defaults
to 1.
@item !DLABX, !DLABY
The number of minor tick marks per major (labeled) tick mark on the x
and y axes if these are linear axes.
@item !FONT
Determines the font to use for the plot labels.  Defaults to 6 (bold
roman serif).
@item !FZ, !FZX
If set to zero, then make the x (@code{!FZX}) and y (@code{!FZ}) axes
start not higher than at 0 -- unless appropriate explicit plot limits
are set through @code{LIMITS}.  @code{!FZ} defaults to @code{0}, and
@code{!FZX} to @code{1}.
@item !FSTEPX, !FSTEPY
If set to zero, then the data value range per major tick mark is
determined automatically; otherwise, it is taken from @code{!STEPX} and
@code{!STEPY}, respectively.
@item !LABX, !LABY
If unequal to @code{0}, then labels are drawn along the x and y axes.
These default to @code{1}.
@item !MXB, !MXT, !MYB, !MYT
The data values that correspond to the edges of the last drawn plot: the
x axis ranged between @code{!MXB} and @code{!MXT}, and the y axis
between @code{!MYB} and @code{!MYT}.
@item !PLTYP
Determines whether the plot axes are linear or logarithmic, and whether
a full plot box is drawn or only an x and an y axis.  If @code{!PLTYP
mod 4} is equal to @code{0}, then a linear-linear plot is drawn;
@code{1} yields a linear x - logarithmic y plot; @code{2} gives a
logarithmic x - linear y plot; and @code{3} provides a
logarithmic-logarithmic plot.  If @code{!PLTYP} is less than 4, then a
full plot box is drawn.  If @code{!PLTYP} is greater than 3, then only
the x and y axes are drawn.  
@item !PLXERRB, !PLYERRB
Determine the size of the vertical (@code{!PLXERRB}) and horizontal
(@code{!PLYERRB}) error bars, in @code{RPL} coordinates.
@item !RX, !RY
If these are set unequal to @code{0}, and if the plot limits are
determined from the data values, then some extra room is left between
the corresponding plot edges and the nearest data points.  They default
to @code{1}
@item !STARTX, !STARTY
The data values that correspond to the first labeled tick mark on the x
and y axes.  If a particular axis was logarithmic, then the
corresponding variable is a logarithm to base 10.
@item !STEPX, !STEPY
The data values that correspond to the interval between labeled tick
marks on the x and y axes.  If a particular axis was logarithmic, then
the corresponding variable is a logarithm to base 10.
@item !TICKX, !TICKY
The size of the major tick marks, in @code{DVI} coordinates.  Positive
sizes correspond to tick marks pointing into the plot, negative values
correspond to tick marks pointing out of the plot.  They default to
@code{0.01}.
@item !TICKXR, !TICKYR
The size of the minor tick marks, relative to the corrsponding major
tick marks.  They default to @code{0.5}.
@item !WXB, !WXT, !WYB, !WYT
The coordinates of the edges of the plot window, measured in @code{DVI}
coordinates.  The lower left-hand corner of the plot window is at
@code{(!WXB,!WYB)} and the upper right-hand corner at
@code{(!WXT,!WYT)}.

Returns the power spectrum of @code{@var{x}} along the indicated
@code{@var{axis}} (which defaults to 0), with power at negative
frequencies transferred to the corresponding positive ones.  By default,
each element of the power spectrum is equal to the square of the
amplitude of the variation at the corresponding frequency, and element
zero is equal to the square of the average value of @code{@var{x}}.  If
you wish to add several elements of such a power spectrum, then you have
to multiply the first and last elements by a factor of 2 first.  This
use is flagged by keyword @code{/POWER}.  E.g., for this implementation
of @code{POWER}, Parseval's theorem reads: @code{MEAN(x^2) =
TOTAL(p(1:*-2))/2 + p(0) + p(*-1),} with @code{p = POWER(x)}, or
@code{MEAN(x^2) = TOTAL(POWER(x,/POWER)).}  If you wish to investigate
the shape of the power spectrum, then you need to do the @code{/POWER}
correction twice to also correct for the absence of a negative frequency
contribution to the first and last elements (whereas all other elements
do have power from a corresponding negative frequency added in).  This
use is flagged by the @code{/SHAPE} keyword.  If you specify
@code{/ONEDIM} but no @code{@var{axis}}, then @code{@var{x}} is regarded
as a one-dimensional array.

Returns a projected version of the two-dimensional @code{@var{map}},
which must be a numerical array.  The eye is @code{@var{height}} units
above the map, measured in units of one map element (as are all linear
measurements in the argument list).  The returned array has the same
data type as @code{@var{map}}.  By default, the returned array has 512
by 512 elements and shows the central @code{@var{height}} by
@code{@var{height}} elements of @code{@var{map}}.

@code{@var{hdist}}, which defaults to 0, indicates the horizontal
distance of the eye from the chosen center of the projection.
@code{@var{angle}}, which defaults to 0, indicates the direction of the
horizontal displacement of the eye, such that an angle of zero yields
the same orientation as @code{TV,@var{map}}, and an increase of the
angle leads to a clockwise rotation of the projection.
@code{@var{mag}}, which defaults to 1, indicates the linear
magnification factor.  A greater @code{@var{mag}} leads to a smaller
fraction of the map being visible in the result.  @code{@var{xmap}} and
@code{@var{ymap}} indicate the map coordinates of the chosen center of
the projection.  This location defaults to the center of the map, i.e.,
to @code{DIMEN(@var{map})/2}.  @code{@var{size}}, which defaults to 512,
indicates the linear size of the array that is returned.  If
@code{@var{size}} is a scalar, then its value is taken for both
dimensions.  If it is an array, then the first two of its elements are
taken for the dimensions.  If @code{@var{hdist}} is zero, then the

The returned star data are observables for an imaginary observer at
the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion and radial velocity are in
terms of barycentric coordinate time (TCB).  For most practical
applications, the distinction between TCB and Terrestrial Time
(TT/TAI) may be neglected.  Usually the result is limited by the
intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-velocity data.

In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's right
ascension and declination are freed from the effects of secular
aberration.  The frame is aligned to the catalog equator and equinox,
is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.

The proper motions are measured in radians per Julian year.

@code{QUANTILE(@var{quantile}, @var{data} [, @var{axes}])}

Returns a particular @code{@var{quantile}}
of the @code{@var{data}}
along the indicated @code{@var{axes}}, i.e., that data value that
exceeds in value a fraction @code{@var{quantile}} of all compared data
values.  @code{@var{quantile}} must be a number between 0 and 1.

@code{QUANTILE(0, data, axes)} is equivalent to @code{MIN(data, axes)},
@code{QUANTILE(1, data, axes)} to @code{MAX(data, axes)}, and
@code{QUANTILE(0.5, data, axes)} to @code{MEDIAN(data, axes)}.  However,
use of @code{QUANTILE} to calculate minima or maxima is not recommended,
because @code{QUANTILE} always sorts the data while looking for the
desired quantile, whereas @code{MIN} and @code{MAX} do not do that and
are therefore faster.

@code{RANDOM( [SEED=@var{seed}, PERIOD=@var{period},] [@var{dimensions}] [,

Returns an array with the specified @code{@var{dimensions}} (which must
be a set of @code{SCALAR}s and/or @code{ARRAY}s) filled with
pseudo-random numbers.  The keywords determine the distribution.  If no
keyword is specified, then @code{/UNIFORM} is assumed.

@table @code
@item /UNIFORM
selects a uniform distribution.  If @code{@var{period}} is also specified, then
@code{LONG} numbers between 0 and @code{@var{period}} - 1 (inclusive) are
returned.  If @code{@var{period}} is not also specified, then @code{FLOAT}
numbers between 0 and 1 (exclusive of the endpoints) are returned.
@item /NORMAL
selects a normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard
deviation.
@item /SAMPLE
selects a uniform distribution between 0 and @code{@var{period}} - 1
(inclusive), but the numbers are in ascending order and no number
appears more than once.
@item /SHUFFLE
selects a uniform distribution between 0 and @code{@var{period}} - 1
(inclusive), but no number appears more than once and they are in random
order.
@item /BITS
selects @code{BYTE} 0s and 1s with equal probability.
@end table

@code{@var{seed}} is an integer seed number for the random number
generation: if you specify the same seed, then you get the same sequence
of random numbers.  There is one seed for @code{/BITS} and one
independent seed for the other distributions.  The initial seed is
@code{123459876} for @code{/BITS} and @code{-123459876} for the other
distributions.  You may specify a seed and no dimensions in calls to
@code{RANDOM} or any of its cousins.  It that case, the seed is set to
the specified value, and a scalar @code{1} is returned.

There are several separate routines that correspond to @code{RANDOM}
with a particular distribution.

The pseudo-random numbers generated when @code{/BITS} is selected follow
from a primitive polynomial modulo 2 with a period of @code{2^31 - 1},
or about @code{2.1E9}.

The method used to generate the pseudo-random numbers with other
distributions is Matsumoto and Nishimura's ``Mersenne Twister'' MT19937
generator.  The period of this generator is @code{2^19937 - 1}, or about
@code{1E6000}.

@subsection READ
@findex READ

@code{READ, @var{var1} [, @var{var2} @dots{}] [, /WORD]}

Reads values from the keyboard or batch file into the specified
variables.  Supports scalars (real and complex), strings, and numerical
and string arrays.  Arrays and strings must be predefined so the number
of elements to be read can be determined from them.  Undefined variables
cause reading of one scalar.  Other variable types are not allowed.
Literal strings in the argument list cause their contents to be written
on the screen (if reading from the standard input) or ignored (if not
reading from the standard input).  Other unnamed variables are not
allowed.

Upon exit, @code{!READ_COUNT} contains the number of read elements.

When accepting input, @code{READ} displays a prompt consisting of the
number of elements read so far followed by a greater-than sign
(@kbd{>}).  During input to @code{READ} through the keyboard, all
command line editing functions are available except for those dealing
with the history buffer (@ref{Command Input}).  If the end of the input
file is reached before all specified arguments have been serviced, then
an error is generated.

For numerical arguments, the input is divided into tokens separated by
whitespace and/or commas.  The contents of one such token are converted
into one value.  Numerical values can be specified just like scalar
values can in LUX scripts, so input @code{10o} corresponds to octal 10
or decimal 8 (@ref{Scalars}).  The token is converted up to the first
character that is not part of any legal number specification.  If a
token contains no legal number, then 0 is returned.

For string arguments, all input up to the end of the current input line
is returned as one value, except if @code{/WORD} is specified, in which
case the next whitespace-separated word is returned.  For string arrays,
the input for each element must be on a separate input line.

Data from a file is read character by character as needed.  Data from
the keyboard (standard input) is read one line at a time.

Reads values into the specified variables from the formatted file which
is open on logical unit @code{@var{lun}}.  Numerical values are assumed
to be separated by strings of whitespace and/or commas.  Arrays and
strings must be predefined.  One value is read for each element of
predefined arrays.  Scalar and undefined variables get scalar values.
The function form returns @code{1} when successful, @code{0} otherwise.
By default, if an end-of-file is encountered before all variables are
filled, then an error is generated in the subroutine form, or a @code{0}
is returned by the function form.

By default, strings are taken to run up till the end of the line.  If
@code{@var{/WORD}} is specified, then strings are delimited by
whitespace and/or commas just like for numerical values.

Upon exit, @code{!READ_COUNT} contains the number of read elements.

@code{READORBITS [, @var{file}, /LIST, /REPLACE]}

Reads orbital data from file @code{@var{file}} for use with the
@code{ASTRON} routine.  The file name defaults to @file{$LUXDIR/orbits}.
If @code{/LIST} is specified, then object ID numbers and comments
included in the file are displayed on screen.  If @code{/REPLACE} is
specified, then the new orbital data replaces previously read orbital
data, if any.  By default, the new orbital data is merged with the
previously read data, if any.

The data must conform to the following description, or else garbage
results and/or errors may result.

Lines with an equal sign (@code{=}) at the very beginning are comment
lines.  The first data line of the file must contain the number of
objects for which data is included in the file.  A comment (initiated by
an equal sign) may follow.

For each object, the first line of the corresponding data segment
consists of the object ID number (which should be distinct from those of
the major objects listed for @code{OBJECTS} in routine @code{ASTRON},
i.e., not between 0 and 8, inclusive), followed by the number of data
lines for this object, followed by the absolute magnitude, followed by
an optional specification of the equinox to which the following data is
referred, followed by an optional data format indicator for the data
lines, followed by an optional comment (initiated by an equal sign).

If the equinox specification is absent, then J2000.0 is assumed.  If it
is present, then it must consist of either a scalar, which is taken to
indicate a JDE (Julian Date/TDT) specification, or one letter out of
@code{j, J, b, B}, followed by a (floating-point) year specification, or
one letter out of @code{d, D}.  If the letter is @code{d} or @code{D},
then the equinox of the date is assumed.  If the letter is @code{j} or
@code{J}, then the unit of the following year is Julian.  If the letter
is @code{b} or @code{B}, then the unit is pseudo-Besselian: Besselian
years are taken to be 365.2421988 days long, and @code{B1950.0}
corresponds to JDE 2433282.4235.

The data format indicator must be one letter out of @code{a, A, q, Q},
or absent.  If the data format indicator is @code{a} or @code{A} or
absent, then each data line for the current object must contain the
following information in the listed order, with all distances in AU and
all angles in degrees: the JDE for which the data is valid (the epoch),
the semimajor axis, the eccentricity, the inclination, the longitude of
the ascending node, the argument of the perihelion, and the mean anomaly
at the epoch.

If the data format indicator is @code{q} or @code{Q}, then the data
format is the same as that for @code{A}, except that the perihelion
distance is substituted for the semimajor axis, and the JDE of the
(last) perihelion transit is substituted for the mean anomaly.

The data segments for all objects in the file must be sorted in
ascending order of their ID numbers.  The data lines for each object
must be sorted in ascending order of their JDE.

Maps a 2D image onto a specified grid and returns the mapped image.
Uses nearest-neighbor interpolation.

@table @var
@item x
the two-dimensional image to be remapped.
@item xgrid ygrid
the remapping cell grid: the coordinates of the corners of the remapped
image in the coordinate system of the old image.  Must be 2D arrays.
@item sx sy
The interpolation grid dimensions within each grid cell.  Must be scalars.
@end table

If @code{ngx}, @code{ngy} are the dimensions of the grid, then the
dimensions of the resulting image are equal to @code{(ngx-1)*sx} and
@code{(ngy-1)*sy}, respectively.

Areas in the remapped image for which there is no equivalent data in the
original image are set to zero.

Identity mapping, i.e., mappings that return an exact copy of image
@code{x}, are given by @code{REGRID(x,cx,cy,nx,ny)} with @code{nx =
DIMEN(x,0)/ngx}, @code{ny = DIMEN(x,1)/ngy}, @code{cx =
INDGEN(FLTARR(ngx,ngy),0)*DIMEN(x,0)/(ngx - 1)} and @code{cy =
INDGEN(cx,1)*DIMEN(x,1)/(ngy - 1)}, with @code{ngx} and @code{ngy}
integers greater than 1.  Some examples of linear remappings, with
@code{nx}, @code{ny}, @code{cx}, and @code{cy} as above for @code{ngx =
2} and @code{ngy = 2}, are:
@table @asis
@item change in scale
@code{REGRID(x,cx,cy,nx/2,ny/2)} makes the image half the size.
@item cropping
@code{REGRID(x,cx/2,cy/2,nx/2,ny/2)} selects the lower half of the image,
i.e., @code{x(0:nx/2-1,0:ny/2-1)}.
@item translation
@code{REGRID(x,cx+100,cy,nx,ny)} shifts the image over 100 pixels to the
left (in the direction of negative x).
@item rotation around the origin
@code{REGRID(x,cx*cos(phi)+cy*sin(phi),-cx*sin(phi)+cy*cos(phi),nx,ny)}
rotates the image counterclockwise over angle @code{phi}, i.e., the
positive x axis rotates over angle @code{phi} in the direction of the
positive y axis.
@end table

If you need to combine some of these operations, then perform them on
@code{cx}, @code{cy}, @code{nx}, and @code{ny}, and only then apply them
to the image.  For example, to rotate the image over 1 radian around
point @code{(100,200)} and expand it by a factor of 3, you could do

@example
 cx2 = cx - 100                ; translate
 cy2 = cy - 200
 cx3 = cx2*cos(1)+cy2*sin(1)   ; rotate
 cy3 = -cx2*sin(1)+cy2*cos(1)
 cx4 = cx3 + 100               ; translate back
 cy4 = cx4 + 200
 y = REGRID(x,cx,cy,nx*3,ny*3)

@subsubsection REGRID Details

@code{REGRID(x,xgrid,ygrid,sx,sy)} and
@code{REGRID3(x,xgrid,ygrid,sx,sy)} work as described below.  The mapped
image values are interpolated from the source image @code{x} on a double
grid.  The coordinates of the points of the coarse grid, measured in the
coordinate system of @code{x}, are given by @code{xgrid} and
@code{ygrid}.  A fine grid of @code{sx} by @code{sy} points is spread
evenly over each cell of the coarse grid, and each point of the fine
grid corresponds to a single element of the mapped image.  The image
value at each point of the fine grid is determined through
nearest-neighbor (@code{REGRID}) or bicubic (@code{REGRID3})
interpolation.

For example, the x coordinates of the points on the fine grid in the
cell identified by cell indices @code{i} and @code{j} are given by
@code{(xgrid(i+1,j) - xgrid(i,j))*ix/sx + (xgrid(i,j+1) -
xgrid(i,j))*iy/sy + (xgrid(i+1,j+1) + xgrid(i,j) - xgrid(i+1,j) -
xgrid(i,j + 1))*ix*iy/(sx*sy)} for integer @code{ix} between 0 and
@code{sx} - 1 and integer @code{iy} between 0 and @code{sy} - 1.

For linear transformations, such as combinations of rotations, scalings,
and translations, only one grid cell (two by two coordinates) is needed.

The bicubic interpolation (for @code{REGRID3}) is based on the sequence
@example
 i = floor(x)
 b = x - i
 a = 1 - b
 w1 = -0.5*b*a*a
 w2 = 1 + b*b*(1.5*b - 2.5)
 w3 = 1 + a*a*(1.5*a - 2.5)
 w4 = -0.5*a*b*b
 y_interp = y(i-1)*w1 + y(i)*w2 + y(i+1)*w3 + y(i+2)*w4
@end example
which yields @code{y_interp} at ordinate @code{x}, interpolated from
@code{y}.  Application in two dimensions yields bicubic interpolation.
This particular form of bicubic interpolation is due to S.K. Park and
R.A. Schowengerdt (1983: Comp. Vis. & Im. Proc., Vol. 23, P. 258; with
ALPHA = @minus{}0.5).

to the original image.  Uses bicubic interpolation.

@table @var
@item x
the two-dimensional image to be remapped.
@item xgrid ygrid
the coordinates of the corners of the remapped image in the coordinate
system of the old image.  Must be 2D arrays.
@item dx dy
the dimensions of the resulting image.  Must be scalars.
@end table

Areas in the remapped image for which there is no equivalent data in the
original image are set to zero.

@subsection ROLL

@code{ROLL( @var{array}, @var{target})}

Returns a copy of the numerical @code{@var{array}} with its dimensions
rearranged according to the value of @code{@var{target}}.

If @code{@var{target}} is an array, then (after any necessary
translation to @code{LONG} type) it indicates the target dimension index
for each dimension.  Dimension number @code{i} of
@code{ROLL(@var{array}, @var{target})} is equal to dimension number
@code{@var{target}(i)} of @code{@var{array}}, and
@code{DIMEN(@var{array})(@var{target})} is equal to
@code{DIMEN(ROLL(@var{array}, @var{target}))}.

@code{@var{target}} must then be a permutation of the numbers @code{0}
through one less than the number of dimensions in @code{@var{array}},
i.e., it must have its number of elements equal to the number of
dimensions of @code{@var{array}}, each element must be unique, and no
element may be negative or greater than or equal to the number of
dimensions of @code{@var{array}}.

For example, @code{ROLL(x,[1,0,2])} is equivalent to @code{x(>1,>0,*)},
and @code{ROLL(x,[2,0,1])} to @code{x(>1,>2,>0)}.

If @code{@var{target}} is a scalar, then (after any necessary
translation to @code{LONG} type) it indicates over how many steps the
dimension list of the result should be cyclically shifted with respect
to the dimension list of @code{@var{array}}.  For example, if @code{x}
is a three-dimensional array, then @code{ROLL(x,1)} is equivalent to
@code{ROLL(x,[2,0,1])} and @code{x(>1,>2,>0)}, and @code{ROLL(x,-1)} is
equivalent to @code{ROLL(x,[1,2,0])} and @code{x(>2,>0,>1)}.

the indicated dimension, starting over for each of the other dimensions.
@code{@var{order}} is the order of the summation, akin to n-th order

@code{@var{x}}, except when @code{@var{axis}} isn't specified or is
negative, in which case summing is done in floating point.  Keyword
@code{/FW_EDGE_NEIGHBOR} governs smoothing near the edges: when set or

@code{/COUNTSPACES} is specified then whitespace counts against field
width.  The function form returns the number of successfully converted
arguments.

@code{SCB, @var{x}, @var{s}, @var{c} [, /EVEN, /ODD]}

Sine-cosine inverse transform (in the first dimension) to
@code{@var{x}}.  @code{@var{s}} and @code{@var{c}} must contain the sine
and cosine coefficients, respectively, as returned by @code{SC}: element
@code{i} corresponds to wavelength @code{NUM_ELEM(@var{x})/i}.

Because of the way the sine and cosine transform values are stored, it
is not possible to unambiguously determine the number of data elements
that @code{@var{x}} should get.  If the first dimension of the sine and
cosine transforms contains @code{n} elements, then these might have come
from an @code{@var{x}} with @code{2*n} or @code{2*n + 1} elements in the
first dimension.  If the highest-frequency sine value(s) is/are equal to
zero, then it is likely that the results derive from transforms
involving an even number of data points, though the zero(s) may also be
due to an odd number of very fortuitous data values.

To resolve this difficulty, the following rules are followed: If
@code{/EVEN} is specified, then assume @code{n} is even.  If @code{/ODD}
is specified, then assume @code{n} is odd.  If neither
@code{@var{/EVEN}} nor @code{@var{/ODD}} are specified, then inspect the
highest-frequency sine transform (@code{@var{s}}) values: if all of them
are equal to zero, then assume @code{n} is even, otherwise odd.

@code{SDEV(@var{x} [, @var{mode}, WEIGHTS=@code{weights}, /SAMPLE,
/POPULATION, /KEEPDIMS, /DOUBLE])}

By default, this function returns the sample standard deviation of
numerical array @code{@var{x}}.

If @code{@var{mode}} is a scalar or an array with a size different from
that of @code{@var{x}}, then it indicates the dimension(s) along which
standard deviations are calculated for each combination of the remaining
coordinates.  In that case, if also @code{/KEEPDIMS} is specified, then
the dimension(s) along which the deviations are calculated are set to 1
in the result.  If @code{/KEEPDIMS} is not set, then such dimensions are
omitted from the result, and if only a single number is returned, then
it is returned as a scalar.

If @code{@var{mode}} is an array with the same number of elements as
@code{@var{x}}, then each element of @code{@var{mode}} identifies the
(scalar) class to which each corresponding element of @code{@var{x}}
belongs, and then a standard deviation is returned for each class.  The
first element of the result refers to class @code{0} (if no class is
negative), or to the most negative class.

If @code{@var{weights}} is specified, then it must be a numerical array
with the same dimensions as @code{@var{x}} (or merely the same number of
elements, if deviations are calculated by class), and then each of its
elements indicates the weight of the corresponding element of
@code{@var{x}}, and then weighted standard deviations are returned.  The
@code{@var{weights}} are copied to a version with the same data type as
@code{@var{x}} for the internal calculations (except that the copy is
kept real even if @code{@var{x}} is complex).

If @code{/POPULATION} or @code{@var{weights}} are specified, then
population standard deviations are returned.  Otherwise, sample standard
deviations are returned.

Complex numbers are supported.

The result has type @code{DOUBLE} if @code{@var{x}} is itself
@code{DOUBLE} or @code{CDOUBLE}, or if @code{/DOUBLE} was specified.
Otherwise, the result has type @code{FLOAT}.

The last calculated standard deviation is stored in @code{!LASTSDEV},
and the associated average (or the real part of it, for complex
arguments) in @code{!LASTMEAN} (except if the standard deviations were
determined by class).

Examples, with @code{X = [[[6, 4, 3]],[[8, 2, 4]]]} and @code{C = [2, 2,
2, 2, 1, 1]}:

To print the population standard deviation along the first dimension
(dimension 0, rows) of @code{X}:
@example
LUX>T,SDEV(X,0,/POPULATION)
      1.247219      2.494438
@end example

And along the second dimension (dimension 1, columns):
@example
LUX>T,SDEV(X,1,/POPULATION)
             1             1           0.5
@end example

To divide each column of @code{X} by its sample standard deviation:
@example
LUX>X /= SDEV(X,1,/KEEPDIMS)
LUX>T,X(*,0)
      4.242641      2.828427      4.242641
LUX>T,X(*,1)
      5.656854      1.414214      5.656854
@end example

To print the population standard deviation of @code{X} for the classes
identified by @code{C}:
@example
LUX>T,SDEV(X,C)
             0      1.414214      2.217356
@end example
Class 0 yields @code{0} because there are no elements @code{0} in
@code{C}.  Class 1 yields the population standard deviation
(@code{1.414214}) of elements @code{2, 4}, and class 2 yield the
deviation (@code{2.217356}) of elements @code{6, 4, 3, 8}.

@node SEGMENT, SEGMENTDIR, SDEV, Internal Routines
@subsection SEGMENT
@findex SEGMENT

@code{SEGMENT(@var{data} [, SIGN=@var{sign}, DIAGONAL=@var{diagonal},
/DEGREE])}

Curvature-based data segmentation in multiple dimensions.
@code{SEGMENT(@var{data})} returns a @code{1} for each element of
@code{n}-dimensional @code{@var{data}} where the data in an
n-dimensional hypercube with sides of 3 elements centered on the element
under investigation shows curvature of the appropriate sign in all
directions through that central element, and a @code{0} otherwise.  For
each direction, the curvature is equal to the sum of the values of two
elements adjacent on opposite sides to the central element minus twice
the central value.  For example, in two dimensions we can regard the
data as an altitude map, and then this function returns a @code{1} in
all places where the central value exceeds the average of the two
adjacent values on opposite sides of the central value in the N-S
direction, the E-W direction, the NE-SW direction, and the NW-SE
direction.  The number of directions to consider per data element in an
@code{n}-dimensional array @code{@var{data}} is equal to @code{m = (3^n
- 1)/2}.

If @code{@var{diagonal}} is specified, then it must have one element per
data dimension and is taken as instructions on which nearest-neighbor
connections to recognize.  A @code{2} means that nearest neighbors with
their @code{@var{bitmap}} values equal to @code{1} are assigned to the
same area if they share any face or vertex in the corresponding
dimension.  A @code{1} means that such neighbors are assigned to the
same area only if they share a face in the corresponding dimension.  A
@code{0} means that connections in the corresponding dimension are
ignored.  If @code{@var{diagonal}} is not specified, then code @code{2}
is assumed for all dimensions.

For example, if @code{@var{diagonal}} is equal to @code{[2, 2, 0]}, then
no connections in the third dimension are recognized, and the data is
treated as a set of unconnected two-dimensional images (but no area in
any of these images shares its area number with any area in any of the
other images).  Within each of the images, connections in all four
directions (N-S, E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE) are recognized in this case.  If
@code{@var{diagonal}} is equal to @code{[1, 1, 0]}, then only directions
in the orthogonal directions (N-S, E-W) are recognized.  Likewise for
@code{[2, 1, 0]}, because even though the first dimension allowes
vertices, the second one only accepts faces.

If @code{/DEGREE} is specified, then the number of directions per data
element that exhibit the appropriate curvature is returned instead.
This number always lies between 0 and the total number @code{m} of
directions given above.  @code{SEGMENT(data, /DEGREE) EQ m} is
equivalent to @code{SEGMENT(data)}, but the latter form is usually
considerably faster because for each element it stops checking as soon
as a direction with inappropriate curvature is found.  For noise data in
arbitrary numbers of dimensions, on average at most 2 curvature
calculations per data element are performed.

If @code{@var{sign}} (when converted to type @code{LONG}) is non-zero,
then negative curvature (i.e., hill-like objects) are sought.  If
integer @code{@var{sign}} is negative, then positive curvature (i.e.,
valley-like objects) are sought.  By default, a value of @code{+1} is
assumed for @code{@var{sign}}.

Zeros are returned on the 1-px-wide edges of the result, because not
enough data is available there to determine the curvature in all
directions.

If @code{@var{data}} is a 2-dimensional array and neither
@code{@var{diagonal}} nor @code{/DEGREE} are specified, then a
special-purpose version of the routine is used that is optimized for
processing speed.  In all other cases a more general but slower version
is executed.

If @code{@var{data}} is of types @code{LONG}, @code{FLOAT}, or
@code{DOUBLE}, then overflow problems may occur if any of its
values have a magnitude exceeding @code{#MAX_LONG/2},
@code{#MAX_FLOAT/2}, or @code{#MAX_DOUBLE/2}, respectively.

@code{SET [, VISUAL=@var{visual}] [, /SET, /RESET, /SHOWALLOC,
/WHITEBACKGROUND, /ULIMCOORDS, /ALLOWPROMTS, /XSYNCHRONIZE,
/PARSESILENT, /ZOOM]}

Modifies the default behavior of various commands and aspects of LUX.
By default, binary keyword selections are added to those already in
place.  The binary keywords are:

@table @code
@item /SET
Clear all previous specifications and set only the specified selections.
@item /RESET
Reset the specified selections so they are no longer active.
@item /SHOWALLOC
[DEBUG] Display information about allocation and freeing of memory.
@item /WHITEBACKGROUND
Make white rather than black the default window background, and
black rather than white the default line color.  This setting has effect
only when opening a new window with @code{XPORT} or @code{TV} or one of
its cousins.
@item /ULIMCOORDS
Count image placement coordinates from the upper left-hand corner
rather than the lower left-hand corner.
@item /YREVERSEIMG
When set, images are displayed with image element (0,0) in the
upper left-hand corner rather than the lower left-hand corner.  This
reversed display is the native format of the X window system, so it may
(slightly) speed up display of images.
@item /ALLOWPROMTS
When this is set, the user can enter one of the valid LUX prompts at the
very start of an input line and such prompts will be ignored.  This is
convenient for entering a set of lines using cut-and-paste with the
mouse pointer.
@item /XSYNCHRONIZE
@code{[@ref{x11}]} When set, internal X window commands are executed in the exact
order in which they are encountered, so that error messages (if any) are
displayed right when the LUX command that generates them is being
executed.  When reset, and by default, X window commands are executed in
the most efficient order, which generally yields faster execution than
with synchronization, but may result in error messages appearing when
much later LUX commands are already being executed.  Synchronization is
useful to find out exactly which LUX command generates a particular
X error message.
@item /PARSESILENT
When set, instructs the parser to not issue warnings at all when
encountering patently unbalanced parentheses, square brackets, or
quotes, mimicking LUX 1, and to issue only bare-bones messages
associated with other parser errors.  Ordinarily, unbalanced items and
other syntax errors yield full-scale error messages.  NOTE: Before
version 3.2.19, a key @code{/PARSEWARN} with the opposite meaning to
@code{/PARSESILENT} was used instead.  With the key, the default
behavior has also switched, to full warnings and error messages.
@item /ZOOM
@code{[@ref{x11}]} When set, images are displayed by default
with the greatest integer zoom factor that allows them to fit in the
window, similar to @code{TV,/SCALE}.
@end table

@code{[@ref{x11}]} If @code{@var{visual}} is specified, then its
string value specifies the visual class you wish to use for the output
of graphics, such as images and plots.  There are six different visual
classes, which differ in whether they support color or only grayscale,
dynamic (changeable) or static colors, and linked or independent primary
colors.  Valid names for @code{@var{visual}} come in three sets.  Names
from the first set all have three characters, the first a @code{G} for
grayscale or a @code{C} for color, the second a @code{S} for static or a
@code{D} for dynamic, and the third an @code{L} for linked or an
@code{I} for independent.  The first set is: @code{GSL}, @code{CSL},
@code{CSI}, @code{GDL}, @code{CDL}, @code{CDI}.  Names from the second
set are the X window designations for these visual classes.  They are,
given in the same order as for the first set: @code{StaticGray},
@code{StaticColor}, @code{TrueColor}, @code{GrayScale},
@code{PseudoColor}, @code{DirectColor}.  Names from the third set
consist of the capital letters from the corresponding names of the
second set, i.e., @code{SG}, @code{SC}, @code{TC}, @code{GS}, @code{PC},
@code{DC}.  Any one of these 18 names may be specified for
@code{@var{visual}}, and all characters may be specified in either lower
case or upper case.

There may be more than one visual for your screen of the class you
specify.  In that case, one is selected according to unspecified rules.

If a connection to the X server was already established (e.g., if you
already opened a LUX window), then a visual has already been selected.
It is an error to call @code{SET} if a visual is already active that
does not match @code{@var{visual}}.  If you wish to change to a
different visual class, then you must first explicitly close the current
connection to the X server (using @code{XCLOSE}), which will delete all
open graphical LUX windows.

Boxcar-smooths @code{@var{x}} along the axes indicated in
@code{@var{axis}} over a number of elements picked from
@code{@var{width}}.  If @code{@var{width}} is an array, then it may have
fewer dimensions than @code{@var{x}} but the dimensions it does have
must be equal to the corresponding dimensions of @code{@var{x}}.  In
that case, @code{@var{width}} is repeated as needed to service all
elements of @code{@var{x}}.  The number of elements around each element
of @code{@var{x}} that is smoothed over is equal to the corresponding
element of @code{@var{width}}.

If @code{@var{axis}} is not specified but @code{/ALL} is, then the
results are as if @code{INDGEN(@var{width})} were specified for
@code{@var{axis}}.  If @code{@var{axis}} is not specified or negative,
then @code{@var{x}} is regarded as a one-dimensional array.  In that
case, @code{@var{width}} must be scalar.

@code{/PARTIAL_WIDTH} determines handling at the edges: If it is set ,
then the edges are filled with the nearest smaller-width value.  If it
is not set, then the edges are filled with the nearest full-width
value.

center of the solar disk as would be seen from the center of the Earth)
om degrees, for Julian Ephemeris Date @code{@var{jd}} (i.e., Julian Date
in terrestrial dynamical time TDT), based on the Carrington rotation.
By default, the angle is reduced to the interval from 0 through 360
degrees.  If keyword @code{/FULL} is specified, then the angle is not so
reduced.  In that case, the number of full rotations that must be added
to obtain an angle between 0 (exclusive) and 360 degrees (inclusive)
indicates the number of the Carrington rotation.

For example, @code{SOLAR_L(CALENDAR([2000,1,1]), /FULL)} yields
-704511.9511 degrees (truncated).  If 1957 full rotations (of 360
degrees each) are added to this number, then we obtain 8.0489 degrees
which is between 0 and 360, so on 0 TDT on 1 January 2000 we are in
Carrington rotation number 1957.

With more than one argument, function @code{STRING} is a synonym of
@code{FSTRING}.  If only a single argument is specified, then this
argument may be a string, string array, or scalar.  With a scalar
argument, function @code{STRING} transforms the argument to an ASCII
string under guidance of the appropriate standard format
(@code{!FORMAT_C}, @code{!FORMAT_I} or @code{!FORMAT_F}, and removes
initial whitespace.  With a string array argument, function
@code{STRING} returns a copy transformed to a single continuous string,
stringing all elements of @code{@var{arg}} together.  With a string
argument, function @code{STRING} just returns that (i.e., does nothing).

The subroutine form converts its arguments to text strings; scalars
(real or complex) are transformed to strings, and arrays (real or
complex) are transformed to string arrays.

In the future, the behavior of the one-argument @code{STRING} function
will be made compatible with the @code{STRING} subroutine.

@code{SVD, @var{M}, @var{U2}, @var{S2}, @var{V2}}
   
Calculates the 'thin' singular value decomposition of matrix
@code{@var{M}}, which is easier to calculate and takes less storage
than the 'full' singular value decomposition.  @code{@var{M}} must be
of a real (non-complex) data type.

If @code{@var{M}} is an m-by-n matrix (has m rows and n columns), then
@code{@var{M} = @var{U} # @var{S} # TRANSPOSE(@var{V})} is the 'full'
singular value decomposition of @code{@var{M}}, where @code{@var{U}}
is an m-by-m orthonormal matrix, @code{@var{S}} is an m-by-n matrix
with nonnegative numbers on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, and
@code{@var{V}} is an n-by-n orthonormal matrix.  The diagonal entries
of @code{@var{S}} are the singular values of @code{@var{M}}

In @code{@var{S2}} is returned a vector containing the min(n,m)
singular values of @code{@var{M}} in non-increasing order.

If m = n, then returned @code{@var{U2}} and @code{@var{V2}} have the
same dimensions as @code{@var{M}}, and @code{@var{U2}} is
@code{@var{U}}, and @code{@var{V2}} is @code{@var{V}}.  In that case,
the 'thin' singular value decomposition is equal to the 'full'
singular value decomposition.

If m > n, then @code{@var{U2}} is @code{@var{U}} except that the
rightmost columns of @code{@var{U}} beyond the first min(m,n) columns
are omitted.  These correspond to the bottommost all-zero rows of
@code{@var{S}}.  @code{@var{U2}} has the same dimensions as
@code{@var{M}}.  @code{@var{V2}} is @code{@var{V}}.  Then
@code{@var{M} = @var{U2} # MDIAGONAL(@var{S2}) # TRANSPOSE(@var{V2}}.

If m < n, then @code{@var{M} = TRANSPOSE(@var{U2}) #
MDIAGONAL(@var{S2}) # @var{V2}}.  In that case, @code{@var{V2}}
is @code{@var{V}} except that the bottommost rows of @code{@var{V}}
beyond the first min(m,n) rows are omitted.  These correspond to the
rightmost all-zero columns of @code{@var{S}}.  @code{@var{V2}} has the
same dimensions as @code{@var{M}}.  @code{@var{U2}} is the transpose
of @code{@var{U}}.

@subsubsection SVD Applications

Applications of the singular value decomposition:

A nonnegative real number @code{s} is a singular value of matrix
@code{M} if there exist unit-length vectors @code{u} and @code{v} such
that @code{M # v = s * u} and @code{TRANSPOSE(M) # u = s * v}.
@code{u} and @code{v} are then called the left-singular and
right-singular vectors for @code{s}.  After @code{SVD, M, U2, S2, V2},
the elements of @code{S2} are the singular values of @code{M}.

The pseudo-inverse of matrix @code{M} with singular value
decomposition @code{M = U2 # MDIAGONAL(S2) # TRANSPOSE(V2)} is
equal to @code{Mpi = V2 # MDIAGONAL(Spi) # TRANSPOSE(U2)}, where
vector @code{Spi} is obtained from vector @code{S2} by replacing each
non-zero element by its reciprocal.  The solution of the linear
least-squares problem @code{M # b = y} is @code{bs = Mpi # y}, but
going through the pseudoinverse is not the most efficient method of
solving the least-squares problem.

The unit vector @code{x} that yields the smallest @code{M # x} is the
right singular vector of @code{M} corresponding to the smallest
singular value.

The null space of matrix @code{M} is spanned by the right singular
vectors corresponding to vanishing singular values of @code{M}.  The
range of matrix @code{M} is spanned by the left singular vectors
corresponding to non-zero singular values of @code{M}.  The rank of
matrix @code{M} equals the number of non-zero singular values.

The matrix @code{Mr} of rank @code{r} that best approximates matrix
@code{M} (by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the difference) is
@code{Mr = U2 # MDIAGONAL(Sr) # TRANSPOSE(V2)} where @code{Sr} is
the same as @code{S2} but has all singular values beyond the first
@code{r} set to zero.

The orthonormal matrix @code{R} closest to @code{M} (under the
Frobenius norm) is @code{U # TRANSPOSE(V)} -- i.e., has all singular
values replaced by 1.

The orthonormal matrix @code{R} which most closely maps @code{A} to
@code{B} (for the orthogonal Procrustes problem) is the nearest
orthonormal matrix to @code{TRANSPOSE(A) # B}.

@subsection SWAPHALF

@code{SWAPHALF, @var{data}}

Swaps elements in numerical array @code{@var{data}} such that each new
coordinate @code{y} of an element of @code{@var{data}} is related to the
old coordinate @code{x} by @code{y = x + n/2 mod n/2}, where @code{n} is
the number of elements in the current dimension.  This swapping is
useful for data returned by certain FFT and Hartley transform routines,
which return the central point of the transform in element number 0.
When @code{SWAPHALF} is used on such data, then the central element ends
up in the center of the data (at coordinates equal to @code{n/2} for
each dimension) and the length of the wavevector is proportional to the
cartesian distance of the associated element to that central point.

@code{SWAPHALF} works only on arrays that have even dimensions only.
@code{SHIFT, @code{@var{data}}} yields the same result as
@code{SWAPHALF, @code{@var{data}}}, except that @code{SHIFT} works for
odd-sized dimensions, too, and is 4 - 5 times slower than
@code{SWAPHALF}.

@node TABLE, TAITT, T, Internal Routines
@subsection TABLE
@findex TABLE

@code{TABLE(@var{x}, @var{y} [, @var{index}], @var{xnew} [, /ALL,
/MIDDLE])} 

@code{TABLE} interpolates in table @code{@var{y}} vs. @code{@var{x}} at
positions @code{@var{xnew}}.  The first dimension of @code{@var{x}} and
@code{@var{y}} specifies the entries in one interpolation table.  Second
and higher dimensions of @code{@var{x}} and @code{@var{y}} specify
individual interpolation tables.  @code{@var{x}} must be in ascending
order in its first dimension.  Dimensions shared between @code{@var{x}}
and @code{@var{y}} must be equal.  Variables are repeated to accomodate
omitted dimensions.  For example, if @code{@var{x}} has dimensions
@code{[2,3]} and @code{@var{y}} dimensions @code{[2,3,4,2]} then
@code{@var{x}} is repeated as needed to accomodate the third and fourth
dimensions of @code{@var{y}} so that @code{@var{x}} effectively has the
same dimensions as @code{@var{y}}.

If no @code{@var{index}} is specified, then keyword @code{/ALL}
indicates that all values of @code{@var{xnew}} are to be used on each
interpolation table.  In that case, the result will have all expect the
first of the (implied) dimensions of @code{@var{x}} and @code{@var{y}},
and all the dimensions of @code{@var{xnew}}, too.

If keyword @code{/ALL} is not specified, then each one-dimensional
vector from @code{@var{xnew}} (e.g., @code{@var{xnew}}(*,2)) is applied
to each next interpolation vector pair from @code{@var{x}} and
@code{@var{y}} (e.g., @code{@var{x}}(*,2) and @code{@var{y}}(*,2)).  In
that case the second and higher dimensions of @code{@var{xnew}} must
match the second and higher dimensions of @code{@var{x}} and
@code{@var{y}}, and the result will have the same dimensions (real or
implied) as @code{@var{xnew}}.  For example, if @code{@var{x}} has
dimensions @code{[2,3]}, @code{@var{y}} dimensions @code{[2,3,5]}, and
@code{@var{xnew}} dimensions @code{[4,3]}, then the result will have
dimensions @code{[4,3,5]}.

If @code{@var{index}} is specified, then it must be an array and each
element of it determines which interpolation table (counting all
dimensions of @code{@var{x}}, @code{@var{y}} except the first one) to
use for the corresponding element of @code{@var{xnew}}.  In that case,
dimensions shared between @code{@var{index}} and @code{@var{xnew}} must
be equal.  Non-integer elements of @code{@var{index}} are treated with
linear interpolation.  The result gets all dimensions of the largest of
@code{@var{xnew}} and @code{@var{index}}.

Keyword @code{/MIDDLE} (set by default) specifies that searching
@code{@var{x}} for a value of @code{@var{xnew}} starts in the middle
(and can then proceed either toward the beginning or the end of the
interpolation table).  If @code{/NOMIDDLE} is specified, then searching
starts at the beginning.

In earlier versions of LUX, a routine @code{POLATE} was available for
linear interpolation.  This older routine has now been superseded by
@code{TABLE}, and @code{POLATE} is now an alias of @code{TABLE}.

specifies the amount of red in the color table section, the second one
the amount of green, and the third one the amount of blue.  The amounts
must be between @code{-1} and @code{+1}.  Positive numbers indicate that
the intensity level runs from 0 to the indicated fraction, and negative
numbers indicate that the intensity level runs from one minus the
indicated fraction to one.  Scalar @code{@var{argument}} equal to
@code{@var{f}} is equivalent to an array @code{@var{argument}} equal to
@code{[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, -@var{f}, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -@var{f}]}.

The "three-color" color table is used by the @code{TV3} and @code{ZOOM}
routines.  If @code{TV} is used with the three-color color table, then
only colors from the lowest section of the color table are displayed.

@code{TOLOOKUP, @var{src}, @var{list}, @var{index}}

Determines a lookup table for @code{@var{src}} in @code{@var{list}} such
that @code{@var{list}} contains no duplicate members, and
@code{@var{index}} contains an index to the member of @code{@var{list}}
that corresponds to each member of @code{@var{src}}.

If @code{@var{src}} has only one dimension, then @code{@var{index}} has
the same number of elements as @code{@var{src}}, and @code{@var{list}}
has the number of elements equal to the number of unique members of
@code{@var{src}}.  In that case, @code{@var{list}(@var{index})} is an
exact copy of @code{@var{src}}.

If @code{@var{src}} has more than one dimension, then its last dimension
is taken to contain the numbers that define each member, and the
remaining dimensions select the different members.  In that case,
@code{@var{list}} gets two dimensions: the first one loops over all
unique members, the second one contains the defining numbers for each
member (and has the same dimension as the last dimension of
@code{@var{list}}).  Then, @code{@var{index}} gets all but the last
dimension of @code{@var{src}}.

For example, if @code{@var{src}} is a 2 by 3 by 4 array, then it is
taken to contain six (2 times 3) individual members which are each
characterized by 4 numbers (e.g., the second member is
@code{@var{src}(1,0,*)}).  If there are three unique 4-element members
in @code{@var{src}}, then
@code{TOLOOKUP,@var{src},@var{list},@var{index}} yields
@code{@var{list}} as a 3 by 4 array and @code{@var{index}} as a 2 by 3
array.  In that case, @code{@var{src}(0,0,*)} is equal to
@code{@var{list}(@var{index}(0,0))}, and @code{@var{src}(1,2,*)} to
@code{@var{list}(@var{index}(1,2))}, and in general @code{@var{src}}
equal to @code{@var{list}(@var{index},*)}.

@code{TRAJECTORY, @var{gx}, @var{gy}, @var{v} [[, @var{n}], @var{ox},
@var{oy}]}

@code{[@ref{develop} package]} Calculates trajectories of particles
under guidance of a specified flow field.  The two starting coordinates
of each particle are taken from @code{@var{gx}} and @code{@var{gy}}
which must be real numerical arrays with the same number of elements.
The velocity field which guides the particles has coordinates either
given by two arguments @code{@var{vx}} and @code{@var{vy}}, or by a
single argument @code{@var{v}}.  @code{@var{vx}} and @code{@var{vy}}
must be two-dimensional real numerical arrays with the same dimensional
structures.  Alternatively, @code{@var{v}} must be a three-dimensional
real numerical array with 2 elements in its first dimension (which count
the x and y coordinates).

The coordinates in @code{@var{gx}} and @code{@var{gy}} are interpreted
such that the first velocity vector resides at coordinates @code{(0,0)}
and the second one at @code{(1,0)}.

If @code{@var{n}} is specified, then it must be a scalar that indicates
(after transformation of its value to type @code{LONG}) over how many
time steps the particles are to be followed.  The integer value of
@code{@var{n}} must be positive.

If @code{@var{ox}} and @code{@var{oy}} are specified, then they must be
named writeable variables, and the resulting coordinates are returned in
them.  If these arguments are not specified, then @code{@var{n}} cannot
be specified either (and a value of 1 is taken for it), and then the
results are returned in @code{@var{gx}} and @code{@var{gy}}.  The
results get all dimensions of @code{@var{gx}}, plus one dimension at the
beginning equal to @code{@var{n}} (but only if @code{@var{n}} is greater
than 1).

Currently, the flow field depends only on the integer part of the
coordinates.  In other words, there is no interpolation of the flow
field for non-integer coordinates, and the flow vectors may change
discontinuously when one crosses an integer coordinate line.  The
trajectory within each integer-coordinate box is a straight line with a
direction corresponding to the flow vector.  Because of the
discontinuous flow field, it is possible that the velocity on both sides
of an integer coordinate line points to the other side of the coordinate
line.  Any trajectory that reaches such an integer coordinate line stops
there.

/SCREEN, /POSTSCRIPT, /PLOTWINDOW, /ZOOM, /CENTER, /BIT24]}

@code{[@ref{x11}]} Displays an image.

Parameters:
@table @code
@item @var{image}
The image to display.  It must be a two-dimensional non-complex
numerical array, except if @code{/BIT24} is specified (see below).  If
@code{@var{image}} is a @code{BYTE} array, then it is taken to contain
indices into the color map and @code{TV} acts like @code{TVMAP}.
Otherwise, the image values are scaled for maximum image contrast.
@item @var{x}, @var{y}
The coordinates at which the image is to be displayed.  They must be
scalars.  The coordinate system is determined by some of the keywords
(see below).  If these parameters are not specified, then the image is
displayed at coordinates @code{!TVIX, !TVIY}.
@item @var{window}
The window or pixmap in which the image is to be displayed.  It must be
a scalar, between @code{-#MAX_PIXMAP} and @code{#MAX_WINDOW}
(inclusive).  If this parameter is not specified, then the value from
@code{!WINDOW} is used.
@item @var{scale}
The scale at which the image is to be displayed.  This must be a
nonnegative scalar.  A value of @code{0} (or @code{/NOSCALE}) yields the
images's natural size (with one array element corresponding to one
pixel).  A value of @code{1} (or @code{/SCALE}) yields the greatest
integer scale value that still allows display of the whole image within
the window.  Any other value (either smaller or greater than 1) yields
an image that is scaled by that factor relative to its natural
dimensions.  If @code{@var{scale}} is greater than 1, then interpolation
is used in generating the expanded view.  The type of interpolation is
governed by @code{!TVSMT}.  If this argument is not specified, then the
value from @code{!TVSCALE} is used.  If @code{/ZOOM} or
@code{/PLOTWINDOW} are specified, then this argument is ignored.
@end table

Keywords:
@table @code
@item /DEV, /DVI, /IMG, /PLT, /RIM, /RPL
These keywords specify the coordinate system in which the position of
the image is interpreted.  The default is the device-dependent
(@code{DEV}) system.
@item /PDEV, /SCREEN, /POSTSCRIPT
These keywords specify where the image is sent.  @code{/SCREEN} selects
display on the screen, @code{/POSTSCRIPT} selects sending to the
PostScript file indicated by @code{!PS_FILE}, and @code{/PDEV} selects
the target based on the value of @code{!PDEV}.  By default,
@code{/SCREEN} is assumed. 
@item /PLOTWINDOW
If this keyword is selected, then the image fills the current plot
window (governed by @code{!WXB, !WXT, !WYB, !WYT}).
@item /ZOOM
If this keyword is selected, then that part of the image is displayed
that corresponds to the last use of @code{ZOOM} (governed by
@code{!ZOOMX, !ZOOMY, !ZOOMMAG}).
@item /CENTER
If this keyword is selected, then the @code{@var{x}} and @code{@var{y}}
coordinates refer to the center of the image rather than its lower
left-had corner.
@item /BIT24
If this keyword is selected, then @code{@var{image}} must be a
three-dimensional non-complex array with 3 elements in the third
dimension.  Then the third dimension selects the red, green, and blue
components for each pixel in the image.  This keyword is only useful
if a 24-bit visual is used (@ref{XOPEN}).
@end table

Affected system variables:
@table @code
@item !TVIX
The @code{DEV} x coordinate of the left edge of the image.
@item !TVIXB
The @code{DEV} x coordinate of the right edge of the image.
@item !TVIY
The @code{DEV} y coordinate of the bottom edge of the image.
@item !TVIYB
The @code{DEV} y coordinate of the top edge of the image.
@item !TVSCALE
The used magnification scale, if any.  This variable is unaffected if
@code{/PLOTWINDOW} is set.
@end table

For backward compatibility with older versions of LUX, if
@code{SET,/ULIMCOORDS} has been executed beforehand, then the position
@code{(@var{x},@var{y})} is counted from the upper left-hand corner
instead, and images are shown with their y coordinate increasing
downward rather than upward.

the bitmaps must have the same number of elements as the image.  Only
between zero and non-zero values is distinguished.  Those parts of the

@code{@var{bitmap2}} (if specified) are displayed in the bottom section
of the color table (greyscale by default).  Those parts that correspond
to ones in @code{@var{bitmap1}} are shown in the middle section of the

@code{XREGISTER}, then all sources (LUX and non-LUX) are monitored.  If
no specific event type was selected, then @code{XLOOP} returns
immediately.

Information about the event is returned as follows:

@table @code
@item !XTIME
returns the time.
@item !EVENTSOURCE
returns the source, as the index of the menu or window plus either
@code{#EVENT.MENU} (= 512) or @code{#EVENT.WINDOW} (= 256).
@item !EVENTTYPE

events. 
@item !KEYCODE, !KEYSTATE, !KEYSYM
returns identifiers for the pressed key, for @code{KEYPRESS} events.
@item !IX, !IY, !XF, !YF
return the coordinates of the mouse pointer in the LUX window, for
@code{BUTTONPRESS} and @code{POINTERMOTION} events.  The coordinates are
in the @code{DEV} coordinate system for @code{!IX} and @code{!IY}, and
in the @code{DVI} coordinate system for @code{!XF} and @code{!YF}.
@item !XMENU, !YMENU
return the coordinates of the mouse pointer in the menu item, for
@code{BUTTONPRESS} events in menus.  The coordinates are counted from
the upper left-hand corner of the menu item.
@item !LAST_MENU
returns the menu number for all menu-related events (not for
@code{POINTERMOTION} events).
@item !MENU_ITEM
returns the menu item number for menu-related @code{BUTTONPRESS},
@code{ENTERWINDOW}, and @code{LEAVEWINDOW} events.

@code{[@ref{motif} package]} Returns the widget ID of a column widget with the
indicated @code{@var{width}} and @code{@var{height}}, and number
@code{@var{ncolumns}} of columns.  If @code{@var{pack_flag}} is equal to
zero, then each next child widget is placed in the next column in which
it is completely visible.  If @code{@var{pack_flag}} is equal to
@code{1}, then each next child widget is placed in the next column,
regardless of visibility.  Also, with @code{@var{pack_flag}} equal to
@code{1}, menu bars are displayed square (if no explicit dimensions were
specified for them).

Unless child widgets have specified sizes, they will all be scaled to
the same width, which is the largest width among the children.

line area at the bottom and a recessed command line history area at the
top, with the @code{@var{prompt}} label in between.  The user can enter
text in the command line area, or select a line from the history area.
When the user accepts the input (by pressing the @kbd{Enter} key, or by
double-clicking on a line in the history area), then it is displayed
below the lines (if any) that were already present in the history area,
shifting the older lines up by one if necessary.  In addition, the last
line is also stored in @code{$COMMAND_LINE}.

The @code{@var{callback}} string is executed whenever the user accepts
some newly entered text.  The widget uses the indicated
@code{@var{font}} and @code{@var{color}}.  At most @code{@var{nvisible}}
lines of history are visible at once, and at most @code{@var{nmax}}
lines of history are available -- with scroll bars giving access to
those lines or those parts of lines that are available but not currently
shown.

button is displayed as a small diamond button with a label after it.
The diamond button looks either depressed (selected), or not depressed
(not selected).  Only one of the radio buttons in the widget can be
selected at any one time, and its diamond button is the only one that
looks depressed.

The radio box widget is placed inside the indicated @code{@var{parent}}
widget.  The radio button labels are indicated by the string argument
@code{label1} and following arguments.  If the last argument is a
scalar, then it indicates the number of columns in which the radio
buttons are to be placed.  The @code{@var{font}} applies to the radio
button labels, and the @code{@var{color}} to just the radio buttons.
The @code{@var{callback}} is a string that gets executed when one of the
radio buttons is selected.  The index of the selected button (with
counting starting at 0) can be found in global variable
@code{$RADIO_BUTTON} and the state of the selected button (always 1) in
@code{$RADIO_STATE}.  These global variables are also used by other

@subsection ZOOM
@findex ZOOM

@code{ZOOM, @var{data} [, @var{bitmap1}, @var{bitmap2}]}

@code{[@ref{x11}]} A routine for inspecting sets of images.

@code{@var{data}} must contain an array with at least two dimensions.  A
two-dimensional slice through the data is displayed in the center of the
current window (based on the current values of the associated global
variables: see below) and a menu of options is shown.  If @code{bitmap1}
or @code{bitmap2} are specified, then the "three-colors" color table is
loaded (@ref{THREECOLORS}) and corresponding slices through
@code{@var{data}}, @code{@var{bitmap1}}, and @code{@var{bitmap2}} are
displayed as if with @code{TV3}.  Currently, the options are:

@table @asis
@item Magnify
Shows the current magnification factor.  If you click the pointer in
this entry, then you are queried for a new magnification factor.
@item Standard Zoom
Returns to the default situation: magnification factor 1, with the image
center in the center of the window.
@item Zoom In (2) Out
Zooming in or out by a factor of 2.  If you click to the left of the 2
(e.g., on "In"), then you zoom in.  If you click to the right, then you
zoom out.
@item Recenter
If you click on this, then you can select a new position in the image to
become the center of attention.  If the image fills the whole window,
then the selected position will be at the very center.
@item Move
This selection enables moving of the displayed image part by moving the
pointer away from the center of the window in the desired direction.
The futher the pointer is from the center of the image, the further the
image moves in each step.  The image only moves while the pointer is
moved, too.  Clicking the pointer anywhere in the window, or
re-selecting the "Move" entry in the menu aborts the moving.
@item Contrast
By default, contrast is determined for each displayed image separately
such that black corresponds to the lowest value and white to the highest
value.  By selecting "Fix", the values that black and white correspond
to are the extreme values in the current image.  By selecting "Let", the
default behavior is restored.  The used contrast limits are displayed on
the next line: If both values are zero, then default behavior is
active.  After clicking on one of these numbers, you are queried for a
replacement value for that number.
@item Colors
If one or two bitmaps are specified in the call to @code{ZOOM}, then
this entry governs the color contrast of the bitmaps.  If you enter a
new value, then this value produces a new color table as if it was
specified in a call to @code{THREECOLORS}.
@item Step
Steps through the images.  If you click on the less-than sign (<), then
you move one frame back.  If you click on the double less-than sign
(<<), then you move back by 5 frames.  Likewise, greater-than signs move
you forward.  The end of the frame range is taken to connect to the
beginning.
@item Play
Play the images in a movie.  Every time you click to the right of the X,
the play speed gains one unit of forward speed.  Every time you click to
the left, the play speed gains one unit of backward speed.  The speed is
indicated (up to 3 units) by the number of less-than or greater-than
signs shown (which is one more than the speed, up to 4 signs).  If you
click on the X, then the movie is stopped.
@item Dims
Shows the data dimensions that correspond to the x and y axis,
respectively.  By clicking on the dimensions you can advance them
cyclically to any desired value.  If the two dimensions are unequal,
then the corresponding new image is shown.  If the dimensions are equal,
then they do not indicate an image, and then nothing new is shown except
that the colon (:) after "Dims" is replaced by an asterisk (*).
@item Mouse Position
By default, the coordinates and data value shown are those associated
with the current pointer position in the image.  If you click on this
option, then you can select a fixed position in the image.  The
coordinates and data value at that fixed position are then shown and the
option changes to "Fixed Position".  If you click on this again, then
the default behavior results again.
@item X, Y
Shows the current image data coordinates corresponding to the 
pointer position.  If the pointer is outside the image, then the nearest
(in some sense) position inside the image is used instead.
@item Frame
Shows the number of the currently displayed frame.  All dimensions other
than those currently displayed are lumped together to yield a frame
number.
@item Value
Shows the image value corresponding to the current pointer position.
@item Quit
Quits @code{ZOOM}
@end table

The following global variables are set by this routine: @code{!ZOOMX}
(the x coordinate -- measured in data units -- of the center of the
displayed image part), @code{!ZOOMY} (the y coordinate of the center),
and @code{!ZOOMMAG} (the magnification factor).  The values of these
variables are used as defaults for the next call to @code{ZOOM}.

@subsection Square Brackets
@findex Square Brackets

@code{[ @var{x} [, @var{y} @dots{}] ]}

Concatenation of scalars, strings, or arrays (numerical or string).
With a single argument, @code{[]} returns that argument with one more
dimension (equal to 1) appended at the high end.  Scalars get upgraded
to numerical arrays, strings to string arrays.

With more than one argument, with not all of them undefined, and with
the defined ones either all numerical or all of string types, @code{[]}
concatenates the arguments.  The concatenation happens in the last
dimension.  If @code{n} is the greatest number of dimensions in any of
the defined arguments, then all defined arguments must have either
@code{n} or @code{n - 1} dimensions (scalars and strings count as having
zero dimensions), and each of the first @code{n - 1} dimensions must
have the same size in all arguments.  The result will have @code{n}
dimensions.  The first @code{n - 1} dimensions will be the same as those
in all of the defined arguments, and the @code{n}th dimension will be
equal to the sum of the @code{n}th dimensions of all arguments (with
@code{n - 1}-dimensional arguments each adding one and undefined
arguments adding none).

Undefined arguments are ignored (if at least one argument has a value),
so you can construct an array one element at a time in a loop without
needing to seed the array with a dummy element, or needing to replicate
the inside of a loop separately for the first element of the array.  For
example:
@example
 DELETE,x
 DO x = [x, more_elements()] WHILE condition

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document @dfn{free} in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

@item
APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The ``Document'', below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as ``you''.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, La@TeX{} input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG@.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The ``publisher'' means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

A section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', ``Endorsements'', or ``History''.)  To ``Preserve the Title''
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

@item
VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

@item
COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

@item
MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

@enumerate A
@item
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

@item
List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

@item
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

@item
Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

@item
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

@item
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

@item
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

@item
Include an unaltered copy of this License.

@item
Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

@item
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

@item
For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'', Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

@item
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

@item
Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

@item
Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements'' or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

@item
Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
@end enumerate

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties---for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

@item
COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all
sections Entitled ``Endorsements.''

@item
COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

@item
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

@item
TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

@item
TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

@item
FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/}.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

@item
RELICENSING

``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site'' (or ``MMC Site'') means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration'' (or ``MMC'') contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

``CC-BY-SA'' means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

``Incorporate'' means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is ``eligible for relicensing'' if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

@heading ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

@smallexample
@group
  Copyright (C)  @var{year}  @var{your name}.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
@end group
@end smallexample

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with@dots{}Texts.''@: line with this:

@smallexample
@group
    with the Invariant Sections being @var{list their titles}, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being @var{list}, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being @var{list}.
@end group
@end smallexample

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
